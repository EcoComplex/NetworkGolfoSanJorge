  abstract = {Benthic—pelagic coupling plays a pivotal role in aquatic ecosystems but the effects of fishery driven interactions on its functioning has been largely overlooked. Disentangling the benthic—pelagic links including effects of mixed fisheries, however, needs sketching a whole description of ecosystem interactions using quantitative tools. A holistic food web model has been here developed in order to understand the interplay between the benthic-pelagic coupling and mixed fisheries in a Mediterranean system such as the Strait of Sicily. The reconstruction of the food web required review and integration of a vast set of local and regional biological information from bacteria to large pelagic species that were aggregated into 72 functional groups. Fisheries were described by 18 fleet segments resulting from combination of fishing gears and fishing vessel size. The input-output analysis on the food web of energy pathways allowed identifying effects of biological and fishery components. Results showed that the structure of the Strait of Sicily food web is complex. Similarly to other Mediterranean areas, the food web of the Strait of Sicily encompasses 4.5 trophic levels (TLs) with the highest TLs reached by bluefin tuna, swordfish and large hake and largely impacted by bottom trawling and large longline. Importantly, benthic-pelagic coupling is affected by direct and indirect impacts among groups of species, fleets and fleets-species through the whole trophic spectrum of the food web. Moreover, functional groups able to move on large spatial scales or life history of which is spent between shelf and slope domains play a key role in linking subsystems together and mediate interactions in the Mediterranean mixed fisheries.},

This study provides the first detailed information on White-headed Steamer-Duck diet composition, foraging behavior and prey availability. This study was conducted in the northern San Jorge Gulf, Patagonia, during 2007. Fifteen feeding territories were identified, and food availability was quantified within them and also within unused areas. A total of 45 feces were analyzed to determine diet composition, and foraging behaviors of females were monitored. Benthic community diversity differed between territories and non-territories. Overall, diversity and invertebrate abundance tended to be higher in territories. Ten invertebrate prey taxa were identified in adult diets, and the most frequent prey in feces were crabs, mussels, and ragworms. Head-neck dipping was the most common method of feeding. Our results improve the understanding of the relationship between diet, selection of areas with special invertebrate availability and foraging techniques used to access and exploit the resources.},

The variation in prey composition and prey size in relation to chick age were evaluated in a South American Tern (Sterna hirundinacea) colony at Punta Loma, Argentina, during the 2006 breeding season. The diet of South American Tern chicks consisted of at least 12 prey items. Fish, mostly Argentine anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) and silverside (Odontesthes argentinensis) were the main prey delivered (91\%) to the chicks. The relative proportion of prey types varied among chick age-classes and the proportion of Argentine anchovy in the diet increased with chick age, reaching 58\% in older chicks. Larger prey items were delivered to older chicks. Prey stolen by other adult terns was significantly larger than the prey actually consumed by the chicks. South American terns at the Punta Loma colony appear to confront the increasing demand of growing chicks by increasing the quality of prey in each feeding trip, reflected in larger and more energetic prey.

  abstract = {Large, complex networks of ecological interactions with random structure tend invariably to instability. This mathematical relationship between complexity and local stability ignited a debate that has populated ecological literature for more than three decades. Here we show that, when species interact as predators and prey, systems as complex as the ones observed in nature can still be stable. Moreover, stability is highly robust to perturbations of interaction strength, and is largely a property of structure driven by predator–prey loops with the stability of these small modules cascading into that of the whole network. These results apply to empirical food webs and models that mimic the structure of natural systems as well. These findings are also robust to the inclusion of other types of ecological links, such as mutualism and interference competition, as long as consumer–resource interactions predominate. These considerations underscore the influence of food web structure on ecological dynamics and challenge the current view of interaction strength and long cycles as main drivers of stability in natural communities.},

May analysed large networks in which species interact at random. However, in natural systems pairs of species have well-defined interactions (for example predator-prey, mutualistic or competitive). Here we extend May's results to these relationships and find remarkable differences between predator-prey interactions, which are stabilizing, and mutualistic and competitive interactions, which are destabilizing. We provide analytic stability criteria for all cases. We use the criteria to prove that, counterintuitively, the probability of stability for predator-prey networks decreases when a realistic food web structure is imposed or if there is a large preponderance of weak interactions. Similarly, stability is negatively affected by nestedness in bipartite mutualistic networks. These results are found by separating the contribution of network structure and interaction strengths to stability. Stable predator-prey networks can be arbitrarily large and complex, provided that predator-prey pairs are tightly coupled. The stability criteria are widely applicable, because they hold for any system of differential equations.},

The Argentine hake Merluccius hubbsi has been the main demersal resource that supports a fishery since 1971. Given that M. hubbsi is a generalist and opportunistic predator, its diet from the perspective of specific composition and feeding strategy was evaluated. Fourteen species were identified belonging to four zoological groups (3 fishes, 4 molluscs, 6 crustaceans and 1 bryozoan). The most commonly consumed prey was the lobster krill Munida gregaria (index of relative importance -\%IRI- 72.19\%) followed by the white shrimp Peisos petrunkevitchi (\%IRI 19.04\%) and M. hubbsi (\%IRI 7.95\%). Most prey were infrequently consumed and at low abundances, which it is common for a generalist-opportunistic predator. Substantial changes in the diet composition were detected when compared to a previous study, showing a large increase in crustacean occurrence in concordance with the abundance changes observed in the environment. The results from this study highlighted the importance to consider information about population trends and trophic relationships to better understand the dynamics of marine communities under exploitation.},

Gaps in the assessments of ecosystem services supply prevent its empirical application. We advance these assessments by providing an assessment tool, which links marine ecosystem components, functions and services, and graphically represents the assessment process and its results. The tool consists of two parts: (i) a matrix following the ecosystem services cascade structure for quantifying the contribution of ecosystem components in the provision of ecosystem services; (ii) and a linkage diagram for visualising the interactions between the elements. With the aid of the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES), the tool was used to assess the relative contribution of a wide range of marine ecosystem components in the supply of ecosystem services in the Latvian marine waters. Results indicate that the tool can be used to assess the impacts of environmental degradation in terms of ecosystem service supply. These impacts could further be valued in socioeconomic terms, as change in the socioeconomic values derived from the use of ecosystem services. The tool provides an opportunity for conducting a holistic assessment of the ecosystem service supply and communicating the results to marine spatial planning practitioners, and increasing their understanding and use of the ecosystem service concept.},

  abstract = {Food chain theory is one of the cornerstones of ecology, providing many of its basic predictions, such as biomass pyramids, trophic cascades and predator–prey oscillations. Yet, ninety years into this theory, the conditions under which these patterns may occur and persist in nature remain subject to debate. Rather than address each pattern in isolation, we propose that they must be understood together, calling for synthesis in a fragmented landscape of theoretical and empirical results. As a first step, we propose a minimal theory that combines the long-standing energetic and dynamical approaches of food chains. We chart theoretical predictions on a concise map, where two main regimes emerge: across various functioning and stability metrics, one regime is characterised by pyramidal patterns and the other by cascade patterns. The axes of this map combine key physiological and ecological variables, such as metabolic rates and self-regulation. A quantitative comparison with data sheds light on conflicting theoretical predictions and empirical puzzles, from size spectra to causes of trophic cascade strength. We conclude that drawing systematic connections between various existing approaches to food chains, and between their predictions on functioning and stability, is a crucial step in confronting this theory to real ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of sex, maturity stage, and body size on the diet of the Magellan skate, Bathyraja magellanica, in the Southwest Atlantic off Argentina, by examining stomach contents using a multiple hypothesis modeling approach. Relationships between the number of prey and sex, maturity stage, and total length (TL) were assessed by built generalized linear models (GLM). Furthermore, we tested whether there was a threshold size at which B. magellanica started or quit consuming a given prey. The overall diet of B. magellanica was mainly consisted of teleosts, followed by amphipods, isopods, and decapods. Ontogenetic diet shifts were independent of sex and maturity stage. However, discrete shifts in diet with TL were found, with individuals larger than 554 and 623~mm TL ceasing to consume amphipods and isopods, respectively. The consumption of teleosts progressively increased with increasing predator size. Likewise, ontogenetic shifts in foraging behavior were also observed with smaller individuals showing specialization on amphipods with larger specimens consuming teleosts. These results confirm that ontogenetic shifts in diet of B. magellanica are more a function of predator size rather than any other life-history traits. We propose that these food shifts are probably related to morphological limitations and abilities associated with feeding habits of skate, so when specimens of B.~magellanica reach an optimum body size, they may have access to higher quality trophic resources. Our results suggest that evaluating the importance of life-history stages on the feeding habits of a species is essential for understanding how that species exploits food resources, which, in turn, is an important factor in developing a suitable plan of marine ecosystem conservation.},

A. castelnaui preyed mainly on teleosts, followed by cephalopods, elasmobranchs and decapods. Small individuals of A. castelnaui consumed decapods and large individuals ate elasmobranchs and cephalopods. The consumption of teleosts was constant along the ontogeny but differed between seasons; more demersal-benthic teleosts were consumed in the cold season, whereas more benthic teleosts were eaten in the warm season. Also, A. castelnaui consumed more cephalopods in the warm season than in the cold season. Benthic teleosts were consumed more in the south region, whereas decapods were eaten more in the north region. A. castelnaui is able to consume larger teleosts as it grows. We conclude that A. castelnaui is a versatile, mainly piscivorous, consumer that shifts its diet with increasing body size and in response to seasonal and regional changes in prey abundance or distribution.},

In general, the diet was composed mainly of decapod crustaceans, followed by teleost fishes. Molluscs, mysidaceans, amphipods, isopods, lancelets and elasmobranchs were consumed in lower proportion. The consumption of shrimps drecreased with increasing body size of A. cyclophora. On the other hand, the consumption of teleosts increased with body size. Mature individuals preyed more heavily on crabs than immature individuals. Teleosts were consumed more in the south region (34º - 38ºS) and crabs in the north region (38º - 41ºS). Shrimps were eaten more in the warm season than in the cold season. Prey size increased with increasing body size of A. cyclophora , but large individuals also consumed small teleosts and crabs. Atlantoraja cyclophora has demersal-benthic feeding habits, shifts its diet with increasing body size and in response to seasonal and regional changes in prey availability and distribution.},

  abstract = {Climate change is asymmetrically altering environmental conditions in space, from local to global scales, creating novel heterogeneity. Here, we argue that this novel heterogeneity will drive mobile generalist consumer species to rapidly respond through their behaviour in ways that broadly and predictably reorganize — or rewire — food webs. We use existing theory and data from diverse ecosystems to show that the rapid behavioural responses of generalists to climate change rewire food webs in two distinct and critical ways. First, mobile generalist species are redistributing into systems where they were previously absent and foraging on new prey, resulting in topological rewiring — a change in the patterning of food webs due to the addition or loss of connections. Second, mobile generalist species, which navigate between habitats and ecosystems to forage, will shift their relative use of differentially altered habitats and ecosystems, causing interaction strength rewiring — changes that reroute energy and carbon flows through existing food web connections and alter the food web’s interaction strengths. We then show that many species with shared traits can exhibit unified aggregate behavioural responses to climate change, which may allow us to understand the rewiring of whole food webs. We end by arguing that generalists’ responses present a powerful and underutilized approach to understanding and predicting the consequences of climate change and may serve as much-needed early warning signals for monitoring the looming impacts of global climate change on entire ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The stability of ecological communities largely depends on the strength of interactions between predators and their prey. Here we show that these interaction strengths are structured nonrandomly in a large Caribbean marine food web. Specifically, the cooccurrence of strong interactions on two consecutive levels of food chains occurs less frequently than expected by chance. Even when they occur, these strongly interacting chains are accompanied by strong omnivory more often than expected by chance. By using a food web model, we show that these interaction strength combinations reduce the likelihood of trophic cascades after the overfishing of top predators. However, fishing selectively removes predators that are overrepresented in strongly interacting chains. Hence, the potential for strong community-wide effects remains a threat.},

Here, we document the species’ precipitous decline in eastern Ionian Sea coastal waters across 13 yr. While 150 animals were present in the study area (1050 km2) in 1996, only 15 were observed in 2007. A 12 mo assessment of fishing effort and catch, together with circumstantial evidence, suggests that the decline was caused largely by prey depletion resulting from overfishing. We analyzed the impacts of various fishing gear and estimated the degree of resource overlap between common dolphins and local fisheries. The total biomass removed annually by 308 fishing boats in the study area averaged 3571 t, while that consumed by common dolphins was 17 t. Resource overlap between common dolphins and fisheries — expressed as an average Pianka index of 0.5 — differed according to fishing gear, being higher for purse seiners (0.7) and beach seiners (0.4) and lower for bottom trawlers (0.1), trammel boats (0.2) and longliners (0.0). Only about 10 active purse seiners (4\% of the total active fishing fleet) were responsible for 33\% of the biomass removal, and likely had the greatest impact on prey of common dolphins. This study indicates a high risk of local disappearance of common dolphins in the very near future, unless fishery management measures are implemented immediately. Purse seining should be the main management target.},

Here, we show a pronounced latitudinal increase in phytoplanktonic and zooplanktonic biodiversity in the extratropical North Atlantic Ocean in recent decades. We also show that this rise in biodiversity paralleled a decrease in the mean size of zooplanktonic copepods and that the reorganization of the planktonic ecosystem toward dominance by smaller organisms may influence the networks in which carbon flows, with negative effects on the downward biological carbon pump and demersal Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Our study suggests that, contrary to the usual interpretation of increasing biodiversity being a positive emergent property promoting the stability/resilience of ecosystems, the parallel decrease in sizes of planktonic organisms could be viewed in the North Atlantic as reducing some of the services provided by marine ecosystems to humans.},

Generalized Linear Models were used to test the effects of Geographic location, Total Length, Sex and Maturity stage on the diet. The most commonly occurring major prey groups differed between Geographic locations. In Río de la Plata (RLP) deep M. schmitti feed on Crustaceans, Fish and Polychaetes, whereas Crustaceans, Polychaetes and Fishes were the main prey in RLP coast, Rincón (RIN) coast and RIN deep, respectively. Moreover, models showed dietary shift related to total length in each Geographic location. In coastal nursery areas Polychaetes decreased and Fishes increased in importance as M. schmitti grew in size; while Crustaceans increased in importance from small to medium size, and then decreased in the large specimens. Deeper areas also show dietary changes related to growth. The trophic level of M. schmitti showed lower values in coastal Geographic locations (3.48–3.53) than in deeper Geographic locations (3.56–3.77). The higher trophic role in deeper communities could be related to the size of M. schmitti which increases with depth. Finally, total vacuity index was 2.47 (the lowest in the literature) indicating an intense and continuous feeding activity of the species.},

Isopods and other crustaceans were consumed more in the south and their consumption decreased as the size of Z. chilensis increased. The TL of Z. chilensis increased with LT from 4·29 to 4·59 (mean 4·53), confirming their ecological role as a top predator. The small and large size classes exhibited a low diet overlap and the highest spatial segregation, whereas medium and large specimens had higher co-occurrence and dietary overlap indices. A clear distinction in tooth shape was noted between sexes in adult specimens, with males having longer cusps. This sexual heterodonty may be related to reproductive behaviour, increasing the grasping ability of males during courtship, because there were no differences in diet between the sexes.},

Ten research cruises were carried out each year during January from 2005 to 2014. A total of 18,461 specimens of Me. hubbsi was analysed, of which 6,777 (36.71\%) contained food in their stomachs.

The frequency of occurrence (\%F) of Mu. gregaria in the stomach contents of Argentine hake increased from the year 2009 onwards, most noticeably since 2011, and mostly over the southern region of the SJG. The main predators of Mu. gregaria in the SJG are two species of teleost fish (pink cusk eel, Genypterus blacodes, Argentine seabass, Acanthistius brasilianus) and three Rajidae skates (Zearaja chilensis, Psammobatis spp. and Sympterygia bonapartii), which exhibited decreased catches in the years analysed. The increased consumption of Mu. gregaria by Me. hubbsi, coupled with decreased trends in abundance of the main predators of the lobster krill during the last decade, indicate that top-down trophic dynamic control occurs in the SJG ecosystem.},

Stomach contents from fish captured using a bottom trawl net, and zooplankton samples collected with a Bongo net, were analyzed. Acoustic data were examined to identify pelagic aggregations and quantify relative prey abundance. The Argentine hake M. hubbsi fed mainly on crustaceans (92.7\%IRI), followed by fish (7.1\%IRI) and cephalopods (0.2\%IRI). Among crustaceans, the diet was dominated by euphausiids (Euphausia spp.), the lobster krill Munida gregaria, and the hyperiid amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii. The most consumed fish was other hake by cannibalism. Prey availability was also numerically dominated by the euphausiids (Euphausia spp.), followed by the hyperiid amphipod T. gaudichaudii and the lobster krill M. gregaria. Ontogenetic dietary changes were detected: consumption of euphausiids and amphipods decreased with predator´s total length, and the consumption of the lobster krill M. gregaria was higher in adult specimens. The Argentine hake M. hubbsi showed positive prey selection for lobster krill M. gregaria. The consumption of Euphausiids decreased with the increasing acoustic abundance of the lobster krill M. gregaria. The cannibalism was denso-independent. The Argentine hake appeared to be opportunistic when the proportion of prey eaten to the proportion present in the environment was compared, but deeper analyses confirmed that zooplankter with increased abundances and higher energy density was the preferred prey.},

  abstract = {The diet of breeding white-chinned petrels was studied during the summers of 1996 and 1998 at South Georgia. Krill abundance/availability was high throughout 1996 but apparently low at the beginning of the 1998 breeding season. The diet of white-chinned petrels was similar between years and consistent with previous studies. Krill Euphausia superba (41–42\% by weight) was the single most important prey item followed by fish (39–29\%) and squid (19–25\%). Meal mass was consistent (110 g in 1996, 119 g in 1998) between years but a significant decrease (46\%) in feeding frequency in 1998 (0.54 meals day−1 compared to 0.75 meals day−1 in 1996) resulted in 19\% less food delivered to chicks in 1998 than in 1996. Breeding success, however, was consistent between years at 44\% and similar to that recorded previously at Bird Island. This is in contrast to black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses, both of which experienced almost total breeding failure in 1998. It is suggested that their varied and versatile feeding methods, together with their greater diving ability, capacity to feed at night and extensive foraging range, help white-chinned petrels minimise the effects of krill shortage.},

  abstract = {The white-chinned petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis) is an abundant, widespread petrel breeding in tussock grassland at sub-Antarctic islands. Over the last decade it has been killed in large numbers in temperate and sub-tropical longline fisheries. However no data are available on the global population status. We assessed the status of white-chinned petrels at Bird Island, South Georgia by comparing the distribution and density of occupied burrows in 1981 and 1998. In both surveys white-chinned petrel burrows occurred in one-quarter of the 460–477 36-m2 quadrats surveyed. The total number of burrows in each quadrat was consistent between each survey but we estimate an overall decrease of 28\% in those occupied (with considerable variation between sites). Concurrent data on breeding frequency and success showed that white-chinned petrels are essentially annual breeders at Bird Island; breeding success was consistent at around 44\%. Significant factors determining densities of occupied burrows were crown height and percent tussock cover (accounting for 77\% of variance). The former has decreased significantly, the latter increased significantly between 1981 and 1998 but there was no relationship between white-chinned petrel occupancy rate and habitat modification due to the presence of fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella). This suggests that any population decline is due to factors operating away from the breeding colony, such as those attributed to fishing.},

  abstract = {A food web customarily describes the qualitative feeding relationships in a community. Descriptors have been used to extract ecologically meaningful information from such data, e.g., the proportion of top species (the proportion of taxa without consumers) or vulnerability (the average number of consumers per taxon). Analyses of collections of food webs based on these properties have revealed regularities that fostered the formulation of models of food-web structure. However, it has been shown that most of these qualitative descriptors are highly sensitive to the varying levels of sampling effort used to document a food web. The principal problem is that webs described extensively include trophic links of highly uneven magnitude, with typically few strong/important links and a wealth of weak ones; with qualitative descriptors, the same weight is given to all trophic interactions. To overcome this problem, food webs should be described and analyzed quantitatively. Consequently, we propose here a suite of food-web descriptors, which are built on information-theory indices and take the magnitude of the trophic interactions into account. We define descriptors having a similar meaning as the classical qualitative indices. Two versions of each quantitative descriptor are proposed, one giving the same weight to each taxon, and one weighting each taxon by the total amount of its incoming and outgoing biomass flows. We use a published quantitative food web to exemplify the computation of the new descriptors, and discuss their potential and limitations.},

  abstract = {Hake (Merluccius hubbsi) stock assessments and management recommendations made as of 1986 for the Argentine Sea, are summarized. The surplus production models used allowed to diagnose an overdimensioned fleet and to establish that, as of 1983, population densities were lower than the optimum values. In 1990 it was mentioned that total landings exceeded the Maximum Sustainable Yield and that the fishing effort was above the optimum exploitation level. The Virtual Population Analysis was first applied in 1993 and, for the 1986-1991 period, a 25. increase in fishing mortality, significant reductions of total and reproductive biomasses and a first catch length of 25 cm were detected. Besides, proposals were made to enhance accuracy of future assessments. In 1994 stock assessment was updated and a significant reduction of the fishing effort was suggested. In 1995 two hake management units were defined and independent assessments initiated north and south of 41°S. The following year risk analysis was introduced and protection of patagonian hake nursery ground was suggested. In 1997 the ADAPT methodology was first applied and, considering the uncertainty of the information available, a risk analysis was performed. Conclusions were that north and south stocks were overfished, that total biomass was decreasing, that reproductive biomass was lower than the biologically acceptable level and that the fishery was sustained by a few year classes.},

  abstract = {There is a widely acknowledged need to explicitly include humans in our conceptual and mathematical models of food webs. However, a simple and generalized method for incorporating humans into fisheries food webs has yet to be established. We developed a simple graphical framework for defining whole-system inland fishery food webs that includes a continuum of fishery behaviors. This range of behaviors mimics those of generalist to specialist predators, which differentially influence ecosystem diversity, sustainability, and functioning. Fishery behaviors in this food-web context are predicted to produce a range of “fishery types” – from targeted (ie specialist) to multispecies (ie generalist) inland fisheries – and relate to the socioeconomic status of fishery participants. Fishery participants in countries with low Human Development Index (HDI) values are highly connected through fisheries food webs relative to humans in more developed countries. Our framework shows that fisheries can occupy a variety of roles within a food-web model and may thereby affect food-web stability in different ways. This realization could help to improve sustainable fisheries management at a global scale.},

  abstract = {Food chains are short, rarely more than five trophic levels long. The cause of this pattern remains unresolved, and no current hypothesis fully explains this phenomenon. We offer an explanation based on the stability of food chains that have been shifted away from linearity to be more web-like. We start with a simple example of food webs of two to six species arranged so that species consume all those with a trophic level less than their own. The probability of stability, for such “universal omnivory” chains declined strongly with chain length, and was as low as 1\% with six level chains but highest for two and three level chains. We further explored the influence of chain length on food web stability by testing food webs with varying levels of connectance that were constructed either randomly or with the niche model. By additionally altering the relative impacts of predators on prey, and vice-versa, we test the role of our assumptions on the relationship between chain length and stability. Food webs characterized by low to moderate degrees of connectance, asymmetrical interactions, and relatively weak density dependence showed a pattern of reduced stability with longer trophic chains. The simple view that food webs characterized by long trophic chains are less stable seems to resolve the long-standing question of why there are so few trophic levels in nature.},

Although there are thirteen possible configurations of three species subgraphs, some are consistently over-represented in empirical food webs. This is a robust pattern that is found across marine, freshwater or terrestrial environments. The preferential elimination of unstable subgraphs during the assembly of the food web can explain the observed pattern. It follows from this hypothesis that there should be differences in the stability of different subgraphs, and that stability should be positively correlated to their frequency in food webs. Using 50 food webs collected from a variety of databases I determined the frequency of each of the thirteen possible subgraphs with respect to randomized webs. Then by numerical simulation I determined the quasi sign stability (QSS) of each subgraph. My results clearly show a positive correlation between QSS and over-representation of the different subgraphs in empirical food webs.},

Previous studies indicated that polychaetes constitute its main food. The contribution of different families of worms to the diet of hawkfish and the relationships between those taxa and the benthic fauna of the feeding grounds are presented in this paper. A total of 522 specimens of fish was measured, weighed and the gut contents analyzed. Polychaete families, mainly Onuphidae, Lumbrineridae and Eunicidae, were the most important feeding items in specimens from 28 to 51 cm total length, both in percent of frequence (\%F) and percent of weight (\%W). Occasional presence of Aphroditidae, Arabellidae, Palmyridae, Lysaretidae and Dorvilleidae was recorded. Bibliographic data on faunistic composition of feeding grounds indicate that polychaetes constitute between 12 to 21\% of number of taxa of macroinvertebrates. C. bergi feed upon 25–38\% of species of polychaetes present in the area. It is concluded that C. bergi feed on polychaetes which are mandibulated, implying mobility over the benthic surface.}

The stomach contents of 218 individuals were analyzed by occurrence and volumetric methods. O. bonariensis' diet is based on insects, scales, plants and detritus. Microcrustaceans (Cladocera and Copepoda) were the main items, allowing the characterization of the species as zooplanktivore. The species has a superior position and protractible mouth, with small teeth, creating a serrated pattern, uniformly lined side by side. There are many gill rakers, that are long and close together (typical of filtering fishes); the stomach is ill defined and the intestine is short. There was a gradual increase of O. bonariensis' abundance during the period of field study, mainly after the second year of damming. This fact seems to be closely related with the high abundance and availability of zooplankton in the dammed environment, and also with the ability of the species to exploit this resource.},

  abstract = {Specimens of flounder Paralichthys orbignyanus (Jenyns, 1842) were collected in Bahía Blanca estuary between February 1997 and January 1998, and their feeding habits were examined in relation to season and size class. The stomach contents of 823 specimens, ranging from 70 to 875~mm total length, were analysed. Their diet included organisms from 17 taxa. The highest vacuity index values were found during autumn and winter. The stomach fullness index indicated that flounders increased their feeding activity between October and March, reaching a highest point in February and decreasing after February. Fish were the primary prey item in frequency, number and weight, followed by crustaceans, such as shrimps and crabs. A seasonal and size class variation was detected in the diet. During summer all-size flounders consumed mainly fish. In autumn, for all-size classes the main food were fish and crustaceans even though fish were dominant in terms of biomass. In spring, crustaceans (mysids Arthromysis magellanica (Cunningham), shrimps Artemesia longinaris Bate, and prawns Pleoticus muelleri (Bate)) were the dominant prey in terms of number and biomass for flounders ≤ 450~mm TL. Size classes larger than 451~mm TL fed on crustaceans and fish though the most important prey item in terms of biomass was fish. In Bahía Blanca estuary,P. orbignyanus evidenced mainly an ichthyophagou – carcinophagous diet. The results collected from the present study lead to conclude that P. orbignyanus shows, in this region, a clear preference for fish.},

  abstract = {Two competing models currently offer to explain empirical regularities observed in food webs. The Lotka-Volterra model describes population dynamics; the cascade model describes trophic structure. In a real ecological community, both population dynamics and trophic structure are important. This paper proposes and analyses a new hybrid model that combines population dynamics and trophic structure: the Lotka-Volterra cascade model (LVCM). The LVCM assumes the population dynamics of the Lotka-Volterra model when the interactions between species are shaped by a refinement of the cascade model. A critical surface divides the three-dimensional parameter space of the LVCM into two regions. In one region, as the number of species becomes large, the limiting probability that the LVCM is qualitatively globally asymptotically stable is positive. In the region on the other side of the critical surface, and on the critical surface itself, this limiting probability is zero. Thus the LVCM displays an ecological phase transition: gradual changes in the probabilities of various kinds of population dynamical interactions related to feeding can have sharp effects on a community’s qualitative stability. The LVCM shows that an inverse proportionality between connectance and the number of species, and a direct proportionality between the number of links and the number of species, as observed in data on food webs, need not be directly connected with the qualitative global asymptotic stability or instability of population dynamics. Empirical testing of the LVCM will require field data on the population dynamical effects of feeding relations.},

  abstract = {1. The effects of towed bottom-fishing gear on benthic communities is the subject of heated debate, but the generality of trawl effects with respect to gear and habitat types is poorly understood. To address this deficiency we undertook a meta-analysis of 39 published fishing impact studies. 2. Our analysis shows that inter-tidal dredging and scallop dredging have the greatest initial effects on benthic biota, while trawling has less effect. Fauna in stable gravel, mud and biogenic habitats are more adversely affected than those in less consolidated coarse sediments. 3. Recovery rate appears most rapid in these less physically stable habitats, which are generally inhabited by more opportunistic species. However, defined areas that are fished in excess of three times per year (as occurs in parts of the North Sea and Georges Bank) are likely to be maintained in a permanently altered state. 4. We conclude that intuition about how fishing ought to affect benthic communities is generally supported, but that there are substantial gaps in the available data, which urgently need to be filled. In particular, data on impacts and recovery of epifaunal structure-forming benthic communities are badly needed.},

For the reproductive study, 423 individuals were obtained in 12 research cruises between 2000 and 2004. Reproductive parameters were analyzed in two oceanographic systems, the Rio de La Plata estuary (ERLP), Argentine-Uruguayan waters, and the El Rincon (ER), Argentina, Buenos Aires Prov. The feeding habits were analyzed using 329 stomach contents of individuals taken in ERLP (264)and ER (65 ER). For this study the individuals were reproductively (adults and juveniles)and seasonality (fall-winter and spring-summer)grouped. In ERLP the maximum total length was 920 mm for females and 865mm for males; in ER the maximum TL for females was 940 mm and for males 890 mm. In ER females matured at larger size than ERLP females and have larger total weight for a give total length. Three reproductive stages were observed in adult females: 1)adult, not pregnant with low GSI and small ovarian follicles, 2)adult not pregnant with high GSI and large ovarian follicles, and 3)pregnant females. The simultaneous occurrence of females in stages 1 and 2 indicates that maturation of the oocytes takes 2 years and implies that the female reproductive cycle is triennial. Alar spines were a dimorphic character due to their absence in neither females nor juvenile males. S. guggenheim could be a depth migratory species, seasonal differences in density were observed between spring and winter. The diet of S. guggenheim was composed of 33 preys, including Teleost, Chondricthyans, Crustacea and Squids. The most consumed prey was Cynoscion guatucupa (. IRI = 7.28. ) following by Prionotus nudigula (1.7. ), Engraulis anchoita (1.6. ) and Raneya brasiliensis (1.52. ). The number and TL of preys were increased with the predators TL.},

  abstract = {There is an increasing interest in dietary composition of threatened seabirds as an important key to understanding their feeding ecology, population dynamics and interaction with fisheries. Several seabird species exploit discards from fisheries as their main food. The southern giant petrel Macronectes giganteus is a wide-ranging procellariform. It is considered a near-threatened species under International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and has been included as a threatened species in the Appendix 2 of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. The diet of Patagonian colonies of this species remains unknown, even though understanding the relationship between southern giant petrels and fisheries may be crucial to the conservation of this species in the Southwestern Atlantic. We describe the diet of the southern giant petrel from north Patagonian colonies using chick regurgitations and evaluate its relationships with the fisheries. Carrion occurred in the diets of 90.8\% of birds sampled, while cephalopods occurred in the diets of 65.1\%. Crustaceans were present in 43.7\% of samples and fishes in 19.4\%. Anthropogenic items were found in 72.7\% of the samples. The presence in the petrel diet of target and discarded species from fishery vessels, and the high incidence of marine debris, suggests an extensive use of discard over the Patagonian Shelf. The population of southern giant petrels in northern Patagonia has reached higher, stable levels. Such a population trend could be linked, at least partially, to the use of fisheries discards.},

  abstract = {Since 1989, interactions between marine mammals and fisheries have been monitored along the Atlantic Patagonian coast. The Argentinian national fishing fleet in the area is composed of approximately 208 vessels (75\% trawlers; 16\% jiggins; 9\% longliners). The fleet operates the year-round from eight harbours between Escondida Island and San Jorge Gulf (80 000 naut. miles2). The important target species are: hake (Merluccius hubbsi), shortfin squid (IIlex argentinus) and shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri), while several tons of other fish are discarded. The dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), the Commerson's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii) and the southern sea lion (Otaria flavescens) are incidentally caught. The dolphins become entangled mainly in mid-water trawls at night, while the sea lions become entangled in any kind of trawl. Annual mortality rates obtained are 170-480 sea lions (mostly males; figure estimated to be 1–2\% of the population size in the area), 70–200 dusky dolphins (70\% females) and 25–170 Commerson's dolphins. Feeding habits of top predators, fish catch and bycatch of the fishery were also studied. Dusky dolphins in the area prey mainly on anchovy and squid, while hake was the most important food item for Commerson's dolphins and male southern sea lions. Squid is also important prey for sea lions and overlaps in size with the fish taken by the commercial fishery. Fishing areas for squid taken by jigging vessels overlap in part with those of foraging sea lions. Even though the commercial size for hake is 30 cm or larger, smaller hakes are largely discarded by the fishery. A combination of operational and specific interactions have been detected. At present, mortality rates seem to be low and there is insufficient evidence of competition for prey species. However, there is concern about the large amounts of fish (particularly hake) discarded by the fishery.},

Motivated by the growth in computational power and data complexity, modern approaches to this question make intensive use of simulation methods. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is one of these methods. Here we review the foundations of ABC, its recent algorithmic developments, and its applications in evolutionary biology and ecology. We argue that the use of ABC should incorporate all aspects of Bayesian data analysis: formulation, fitting, and improvement of a model. ABC can be a powerful tool to make inferences with complex models if these principles are carefully applied.},

  abstract = {Acknowledging ecological interactions, such as predation, is key to an ecosystem approach to fisheries. Trophodynamic indicators are needed to measure the strength of the interactions between the different living components, and of structural ecosystem changes resulting from exploitation. We review trophodynamic indicators derived from models, as well as from emergent patterns such as trophic cascades and regime shifts. From 46 indicators identified in the literature, six (catch or biomass ratios, primary production required to support catch, production or consumption ratios and predation mortality, trophic level of the catch, fishing-in-balance, and mixed trophic impact) were selected because of their ability to reveal ecosystem-level patterns, and because they match published criteria. This suite of indicators is applied to the northern and southern Benguela ecosystems, and their performance is evaluated to depict drastic and contrasted ecosystem changes. A few complementary indicators are suggested as needed to detect the trophodynamic impacts of fisheries and ecosystem changes. Trends in indicators are sensitive to the choice of trophic level made for certain species. Trophodynamic indicators appear to be conservative, because they respond slowly to large structural changes in an ecosystem. Application of the selected indicators to other marine ecosystems is encouraged so as to evaluate fully their usefulness to an ecosystem approach to fisheries, and to establish international comparability.},

Here, we estimated the links among environmental conditions, richness, food-web structure, annual biomass and its temporal stability using a standardised monitoring dataset of 99 stream fish communities spanning from 1995 to 2018. We first revealed that both richness and average trophic level are positively related to annual biomass, with effects of similar strength. Second, we found that community stability is fostered by mean trophic level, while contrary to expectation, it is decreased by species richness. Finally, we found that environmental conditions affect both biomass and its stability mainly via effects on richness and network structure. Strikingly, the effect of species richness on community stability was mediated by population stability rather than synchrony, which contrasts with results from single trophic communities. We discuss the hypothesis that it could be a characteristic of multi-trophic communities.},

Dusky dolphins are an integral part of several marine ecosystems of the southern hemisphere. Among other cetaceans, pinnipeds, seabirds, and sharks, dusky dolphins represent the near-terminal links in the food webs in which they are embedded. This set of species is also referred to as the “top predators” or “upper trophic level predators” and the study of the trophic role dusky dolphins play in marine ecosystems is driven mostly by the same interests that one has in top predators. The goal of this chapter is to briefly summarize what is known about their trophic ecology and to attempt to develop, within the limitations of the available data, an initial description of the trophic role of dusky dolphins in their ecosystems. To achieve this goal, several topics are presented, including diet and feeding habits, relationships with other top predators, competition and kleptoparasitism, the role in the transmission of parasites, and finally their trophic relationships with fisheries.},

Bearing in mind the different characteristics of ice-chilling and freezer fleets, their activities were analyzed separately. Considering the relative percentages of catches declared in fishery statistics, the dynamics of each fleet is described per quarter and year. Special reference is made to 1997 when a closed area to protect juveniles was introduced between 44°S-47°S and 62°W-65°W. The freezer fleet activity, concentrated South of 41°S, especially South of 43°S, was stable throughout the period. It grouped around the closed area of Escondida Island during the summer 1st and 4th quarters) to disperse in deeper waters in winter 2nd and 3rd quarters. In the 2nd quarter it formed two nuclei, one to the North -and the most important- to the South of 41°S. The dynamics of the ice-chilling fleet per season was similar to that of the freezer fleetnevertheless, contrary to the latter, activities concentrated between 39°S and 42°S and, of the two  nuclei formed in the 2nd quarter, the most important was the one North of 41°S. In 1995 a marked change was observed when concentration of the fleet ranged between 39°S and 42°S and the South nucleus practically disappeared.},

  abstract = {The worldwide shrimp (Penaeid) landings has remained stable in almost 3.5 metric tons since 2012. The Argentine red shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri) fishery done in the Argentine Sea, has been the only crustacean fishery increasing their captures and its total value in recent years (FAO, 2016). Historically, landings of this species has been highly variable, with inter-annual differences of up to 30,000 metric tons, but since the 2006 fishing season annual landings have consistently increased up to a maximum of 170,000 tons in 2016 (Argentine Statistics, SSPyA, 2017). The Argentine red shrimp is the main target of part of the Argentinian freezer trawlers exclusively dedicated to catch this crustacean, in addition to coastal and deep-sea fresh trawlers that, depending on the commercially available marine resources, decide which species to catch. It life cycle is exclusively spent in marine waters, without any need to migrate to coastal lagoons and/or estuaries as other Penaeid families, thus being distinguished from most commercial subtropical and tropical shrimps. This shrimp fishery has been extensively studied by Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo Pesquero (INIDEP) since its beginnings, when large volume shoaling were detected in San Jorge Gulf at the beginning of the 1980s by the fishing fleet . INIDEP research is intended to present scientific data and management tools to avoid growth and/or recruitment overfishing of this important fishery for Argentina, with the objective to look for ecological sustainability. Studies regarding shrimp population dynamics, fishery assessment, status evaluation of benthic organisms found in the shrimp distribution areas, and continuous surveillance of the bycatch of bony and cartilaginous fish are carried out. Ecosystem approach goals are being developed with the purpose of understand and manage the ecosystem where the species thrive.Its northern and southern limit distribution are: Río de Janeiro, Brazil (23°00'S) and Santa Cruz, Argentina (50°0'S).},

  abstract = {Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems ? such as communities ? through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with ? what we believe to be ? their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.},

Here we infer the expansion of Munida gregaria populations in the Beagle Channel and the Argentine Patagonian Shelf by means of acoustic surveys of pelagic swarms. We also describe the habitat characteristics in which these swarms occur. Acoustic data was collected during three multidisciplinary scientific cruises on board of the R/V Puerto Deseado during 2009, 2012 and 2014. Despite differences in the environmental conditions between the two surveyed areas, between 2009 and 2014 pelagic swarms increased their occurrence and abundance both in the Beagle Channel and on the Argentine Patagonian Shelf. Towards the end of the studied period, pelagic swarms of M. gregaria occurred in new locations, supporting the notion of a population expansion. Within the Beagle Channel swarm expansions were more marked than on the Patagonian Shelf. We here postulate that M. gregaria expansions occur in association with productive areas of the Argentine continental shelf, such as frontal zones, favoured by the squat lobster phenotypic plasticity that permit to exploit resources in both the neritic and benthic environments. At a regional scale on the Patagonian Shelf, three main groups of pelagic swarms of M. gregaria were clearly associated to respective frontal zones. The information presented here is necessary to understand fluctuations in both distribution and abundance patterns of a key species on the Argentine continental shelf. These fluctuations could be direct or indirect indicators of changes in the ecosystem.},

  abstract = {The consensus that complexity begets stability in ecosystems was challenged in the seventies, a result recently extended to ecologically-inspired networks. The approaches assume the existence of a feasible equilibrium, i.e. with positive abundances. However, this key assumption has not been tested. We provide analytical results complemented by simulations which show that equilibrium feasibility vanishes in species rich systems. This result leaves us in the uncomfortable situation in which the existence of a feasible equilibrium assumed in local stability criteria is far from granted. We extend our analyses by changing interaction structure and intensity, and find that feasibility and stability is warranted irrespective of species richness with weak interactions. Interestingly, we find that the dynamical behaviour of ecologically inspired architectures is very different and richer than that of unstructured systems. Our results suggest that a general understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires focusing on the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture.},

  abstract = {Determining the importance of physical and biological drivers in shaping biodiversity in diverse ecosystems remains a global challenge. Advancements have been made towards this end in large marine ecosystems with several studies suggesting environmental forcing as the primary driver. However, both empirical and theoretical studies point to additional drivers of changes in diversity involving trophic interactions and, in particular, predation. Moreover, a more integrated but less common approach to the assessment of biodiversity changes involves analyses of spatial β diversity, whereas most studies to date assess only changes in species richness (α diversity). Recent research has established that when cod, a dominant generalist predator, was overfished and collapsed in a northwest Atlantic food web, spatial β diversity increased; that is, the spatial structure of the fish assemblage became increasingly heterogeneous. If cod were to recover, would this situation be reversible, given the inherent complexity and non-linear dynamics that typify such systems? A dramatic increase of cod in an ecologically similar large marine ecosystem may provide an answer. Here we show that spatial β diversity of fish assemblages in the Barents Sea decreased with increasing cod abundance, while decadal scale changes in temperature did not play a significant role. These findings indicate a reversibility of the fish assemblage structure in response to changing levels of an apex predator and highlight the frequently overlooked importance of trophic interactions in determining large-scale biodiversity patterns. As increased cod abundance was largely driven by changes in fisheries management, our study also shows that management policies and practices, particularly those involving apex predators, can have a strong effect in shaping spatial diversity patterns, and one should not restrict the focus to effects of climate change alone.},

The local stability properties of the resulting food web models were then determined. * 5We found that by choosing interaction strengths using an empirically defined scaling law, the resulting food web models are always dynamically stable, despite the residual uncertainties in the modelling approach. This contrasts with the statistical expectation that random webs with random parameters have a vanishingly improbable chance of stability. * 6The patterning of predator and prey body sizes in real ecosystems affects the arrangement of interaction strengths, which in turn determines food web stability.},

A total of 1,047 stomachs were analyzed and 98~\% of them contained food. The low proportion of empty stomachs recorded and the presence of prey in different stages of digestion suggested that this skate was a continuous feeder. A total of 81 prey items were identified. However, the diet was mainly composed of crabs. Other important groups in its diet were teleost fishes, shrimps and prawns, bivalves and worms. At the species level, the crab Peltarion spinosulum accounted for the highest contribution and the anchovy Engraulis anchoita ranked second in importance. By analyzing its diet composition, it was possible to classify S. bonapartii as a benthic predator, as are other skates reaching a similar maximum size. In addition, it was placed in the functional group of species that mainly feeds on decapod crustaceans. Trophic level was estimated at 3.61, indicating that the species was a secondary consumer. Significant differences were found in the diet according to sex, size class and season. These differences may be due to extrinsic and intrinsic factors that could be operating together.},

Theory holds that colonisation rate is a primary driver of community assembly. We present new data from a mesocosm experiment to test the hypothesis that colonisation rate also determines the assembly dynamics of food webs. By manipulating colonisation rate and measuring webs through time, we show how colonisation rate governs structural changes during assembly. Webs experiencing different colonisation rates had stable topologies despite significant species turnover, suggesting that some features of network architecture emerge early and change little through assembly. But webs experiencing low colonisation rates showed less variation in the magnitudes of trophic fluxes, and were less likely to develop coupled fast and slow resource channels – a common feature of published webs. Our results reveal that food web structure develops according to repeatable trajectories that are strongly influenced by colonisation rate.},

  abstract = {Animals may develop behavioral responses to avoid discomforting situations. In particular, pain can result in learned avoidance behaviors. We report such a case in southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) that have been the target of attacks by kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus) that feed on their skin and blubber in the surrounded waters of Península Valdés, Chubut (Argentina) since the 1980s. The increase in the attacks over the years triggered on whales the development of alternative postures to keep their backs protected from the gulls. Recently, a particular avoidance behavior has been observed, the “oblique breathing,” in which whales breathe with only the head out of the water. The main goal of this work is to describe the emergence of oblique breathing in two areas of Golfo Nuevo (P. Valdés) which have high number of whales and gull attacks, during the whale reproductive seasons in 2010, 2012 and 2013. Results suggest that all age and sex classes of whales can breathe obliquely. Emergence of the oblique breathing seems to have proceeded in three stages: (1) the origin, with rare observations, (2) the spread, when the behavior was registered only during gull attacks and (3) the establishment, when whales performed it in a preventive manner, even when attacks were not occurring. Oblique breathing is likely to pose extra energy costs, which could be detrimental to whales, especially for recently born calves. However, given the increasing prevalence of this behavior, it seems to be a useful strategy to prevent harassment by gulls.},

  abstract = {Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 1055–1071 Abstract Whereas many land predators disappeared before their ecological roles were studied, the decline of marine apex predators is still unfolding. Large sharks in particular have experienced rapid declines over the last decades. In this study, we review the documented changes in exploited elasmobranch communities in coastal, demersal, and pelagic habitats, and synthesize the effects of sharks on their prey and wider communities. We show that the high natural diversity and abundance of sharks is vulnerable to even light fishing pressure. The decline of large predatory sharks reduces natural mortality in a range of prey, contributing to changes in abundance, distribution, and behaviour of small elasmobranchs, marine mammals, and sea turtles that have few other predators. Through direct predation and behavioural modifications, top-down effects of sharks have led to cascading changes in some coastal ecosystems. In demersal and pelagic communities, there is increasing evidence of mesopredator release, but cascading effects are more hypothetical. Here, fishing pressure on mesopredators may mask or even reverse some ecosystem effects. In conclusion, large sharks can exert strong top-down forces with the potential to shape marine communities over large spatial and temporal scales. Yet more empirical evidence is needed to test the generality of these effects throughout the ocean.},

The question remains as to what extent different network properties are related and how understanding this relationship can advance our comprehension of the mechanisms behind these patterns. 3.?Here, we analysed the relationship between nestedness and modularity, two frequently studied network properties, for a large data set of 95 ecological communities including both plant?animal mutualistic and host?parasite networks. 4.?We found that the correlation between nestedness and modularity for a population of random matrices generated from the real communities decreases significantly in magnitude and sign with increasing connectance independent of the network type. At low connectivities, networks that are highly nested also tend to be highly modular; the reverse happens at high connectivities. 5.?The above result is qualitatively robust when different null models are used to infer network structure, but, at a finer scale, quantitative differences exist. We observed an important interaction between the network structure pattern and the null model used to detect it. 6.?A better understanding of the relationship between nestedness and modularity is important given their potential implications on the dynamics and stability of ecological communities.},

  abstract = {Short-term effects of bottom trawling on a 'hard-bottom' (pebble, cobble, and boulder) seafloor were studied on the outer continental shelf in the eastern Gulf of Alaska. Eight sites were trawled in August 1996; then, from a research submersible we videotaped each trawl path and a nearby reference transect to obtain quantitative data. Boulders were displaced, and large epifaunal invertebrates were removed or damaged by a single trawl pass. These structural components of habitat were the dominant features on the seafloor. There was a significant decrease in density, and an increase in damage, to sponges and anthozoans in trawled versus reference transects. Changes in density, or damage to most motile invertebrates were not detected. Delayed mortality, of apparently undamaged invertebrates, may have resulted in greater impact than we detected. Alternatively, over time, some invertebrates may have recovered from any damage previously suffered. A subsequent survey at these sites will address these questions.},

We surveyed articles published in 2009 and 2010 in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, noting the statistical analyses reported and the associated reporting of effect size estimates. Effect sizes were reported for fewer than half of the analyses; no article reported a confidence interval for an effect size. The most often reported analysis was analysis of variance, and almost half of these reports were not accompanied by effect sizes. Partial η2 was the most commonly reported effect size estimate for analysis of variance. For t tests, 2/3 of the articles did not report an associated effect size estimate; Cohen's d was the most often reported. We provide a straightforward guide to understanding, selecting, calculating, and interpreting effect sizes for many types of data and to methods for calculating effect size confidence intervals and power analysis.},

  abstract = {Moving toward ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) necessitates a suite of ecological indicators that are responsive to fishing pressure, capable of tracking changes in the state of marine ecosystems, and related to management objectives. In this study, we employed the gradient forest method to assess the performance of 14 key ecological indicators in terms of specificity, sensitivity and the detection of thresholds for EBFM across ten marine ecosystems using four modelling frameworks (Ecopath with Ecosim, OSMOSE, Atlantis, and a multi-species size-spectrum model). Across seven of the ten ecosystems, high specificity to fishing pressure was found for most of the 14 indicators. The indicators biomass to fisheries catch ratio (B/C), mean lifespan and trophic level of fish community were found to have wide utility for evaluating fishing impacts. The biomass indicators, which have been identified as Essential Ocean Variables by the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), had lower performance for evaluating fishing impacts, yet they were most sensitive to changes in primary productivity. The indicator B/C was most sensitive to low levels of fishing pressure with a generally consistent threshold response around 0.4*FMSY (fishing mortality rate at maximum sustainable yield) across nine of the ten ecosystems. Over 50\% of the 14 indicators had threshold responses at, or below\,∼0.6* FMSY for most ecosystems, indicating that these ecosystems would have already crossed a threshold for most indicators when fished at FMSY. This research provides useful insights on the performance of indicators, which contribute to facilitating the worldwide move toward EBFM.},

  abstract = {Forage species are key nodes in the energy fluxes between benthic and pelagic zones. The squat lobster, Munida gregaria, is a common forage species of the Southern Hemisphere and its abundance is increasing. This species presents two ecotypes: one (subrugosa) that settles on the sea bottom immediately after the metamorphosis and another (gregaria) that remains in the water column for a variable period of time, before adopting a benthic habit. Hypotheses on its settlement are conflicting; one proposes that it is a density-dependent process of the sea bottom and the other that it is regulated by the availability of pelagic food. To rule out whether feeding factors could be significant in the decision-making process, the first step is to identify whether the ecotypes have different diets or not. This study compared the isotopic niche location, the trophic levels and the reliance on benthic or pelagic resources between ecotypes. Among all sampling events, the isotopic niches of the gregaria and the subrugosa ecotypes were significantly distant from each other. In addition, the difference in δ13C values between ecotypes covered an average of 75\% of the total difference between pelagic and benthic pathways. Benthic individuals relied mostly on benthic animals, while pelagic individuals relied on pelagic primary producers. Overall, results show that each ecotype feeds mainly on different energy pathways. Considering its feeding ecology and movements during life history, M. gregaria is a key component of bentho-pelagic coupling.},

  abstract = {Two of the most important frontal systems of the Argentine Sea (SW Atlantic Ocean) were compared to obtain evidences on the regulatory mechanisms of food web length, incorporating both spatial (areas within fronts) and temporal (presence or absence of frontal structure) variability. The stable isotopes of Carbon and Nitrogen were used to evaluate the origin and composition of the organic matter used by primary consumers, the structure of food webs, the trophic levels of several taxa and the benthic-pelagic coupling within each system. In the Río de la Plata estuarine front, different sources of organic matter would support the food webs occurring in the three areas of the system. The particulate organic material (POM) would be the main resource supporting the food web in the mixohaline area, although with different composition between surface and bottom layers. The similarity of the \textasciitilde d\textsuperscript{13}C signature between the fluvial detritus and the surface POM revealed a strong river-estuary coupling. On the contrary, the salt marsh area did not contribute significantly to POM composition. Consumers of the three areas used both in situ generated and alocthonous resources. A clear division between those species that used planktonic (estuarine or river species) and benthic resources (sea-originated) was observed. Invertebrates such as Acartia tonsa and Neomysis americana were the base of the planktonic food web and canalized most part of the energy present in the system (detritus and POM). The salt marsh contribution to the estuarine system was restricted to crabs from the tidal plain. The trophic level of fish community mostly corresponded to secondary consumers. In the tidal front, there were differences in the POM composition between homogeneous and stratified sectors. Notwithstanding that, the trophic structure was similar between sectors, with variations in the composition of primary consumers. The different signatures of lower consumers were integrated by higher order consumers (fishes). Two trophic pathways (herbivorous and microbial) may dominate in different areas and periods. The fish community was characterized by a higher trophic level (mostly third consumers). The productivity, environmental compartmentation and species diversity affected the trophic structure differently in each front. The structure of the estuarine trophic food web was based on a few dominant species in the lower levels that canalized most part of the energy, a high trophic dependence of these species to fish community and, as a corollary, a classic and short trophic food web stable through time. In the tidal front, the trophic food web presented spatio-temporal fluctuations in the POM composition, a strong benthic-pelagic coupling with a great proportion of fish using benthic preys and a larger food web than in the estuary. This study indicates that high resource availability alone is not an indicator of a longer food web.},

We worked with the fishing fleet operating at Golfo San Jorge with onboard observers over 200 days in 1995-1997, sampling fishery by-catch and entangled birds. Penguins were affected during the austral summer. Estimations of mortality rates showed 0.33\% of the breeding population at Golfo San Jorge is incidentally killed by the shrimp fishery every summer. By-catch in shrimp fishery nets was composed of species important as penguin prey (anchovy and hake) in higher proportions during summer. The daily by-catch of these species was higher than the total calculated daily intake for all penguins breeding in the Golfo San Jorge. This could have a significant effect on birds. We recommend that an observer program be implemented to monitor seabird mortality and that fishing gear should be improved to reduce the indirect effect of the fish by-catch on penguins.},

The stomach contents of 3323 individual captured in research cruises carried out during 2004 and 2005 was determined. In the diet 39 prey items were identified corresponding to 4 Phyla. Trophic spectrum was determined with Index of Relative Importance (IRI), where fishes were the principal prey (72,53 percentage IRI), crustaceans were secondary prey (27,44 percentage IRI) and with minor values polychaetes and mollusk (0,2 percentageIRI) were found. Pelagic fish was the predominant food item and Engraulis anchoita (75, 02 percentage IRI) was the most important prey along the year and in both study areas.  Other fish item were the horse mackerel (Trachurus lathami, 2,56 percentage IRI) and the anchovy (Anchoa marinii, 0,56 percentage IRI). The crustacean Peisos petrunkevitchi (11,75 percentage IRI) was the most important and in second order Argentine stiletto shrimp (Artemesia longinaris, 0,81 percentage IRI) y Argentine red shrimp langostino (Pleoticus muelleri, 0,51 percentage IRI) were found.

Significant differences were found when comparing the diet among individuals in both study areas mainly due to the biggest contribution of fish.

Trophic niche breadth was narrower in the north area than in the south, similar results were obtained when we discriminate between sexes and sizes too.

Squalus acanthias (Squalidae) and  Raja flavirostris (=Dipturus chilensis )(Rajidae), are two elasmobranchs with high apparition frequencies in the SW Atlantic, in the coastal and demersal fishing trawls, co-existing and predating on the principal stocks of bony fish there located, especially the Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi). Both species could be transformed into alternative fishing resources, even though they are not currently commercially developed as such. The knowledge on their biology, given in great detail, will provide information for a better conservation and management, since their own elasmobranch characteristics (slow growth, late first maturity and reduced number of pups of great size), make them highly vulnerable to intensive fisheries. Information was taken from 19 research cruises, held by the R/Vs of the National Institute of Fisheries Research and Development (INIDEP, Mar del Plata, Argentina) during 1985 and 1998 in the area between 34°and 56°S. The geographical and seasonal distribution by size of  S.acanthias  and R.flavirostris is analyzed during an annual cycle, in relation with the environmental factors. Comments on its reproductive characteristics and a synthesis on the evolution of their fisheries in the Argentine Sea are made.Trophic spectrum, interspecific trophic relationships and predation on Argentine hake are studied considering three zones, 1) Argentine-Uruguyan Common Fishing Area including southern Buenos Aires (34°-41°S); 2) northern Patagonia (41°-48°S); and 3) southern Patagonia (48°-56°S).

The diet of Cayenne and Royal Terns comprised nine and 10 prey species respectively. Fish comprised {$>$}99\% of the prey of both species of tern in the two study years. Both species had a fairly specialised diet based on pelagic schooling fish, mostly Argentine Anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) and two species of silversides (Odontesthes spp.). Despite observed overlap in trophic resources, our results showed that Argentine Anchovy was the main prey for Royal Terns, whereas the two species of silversides together with Anchovy comprised the bulk of the diet for Cayenne Terns. Fish delivered by Cayenne Terns were significantly smaller than those by Royal Terns. Results suggested that both type and size of prey may be important factors permitting food partitioning between the two species of tern during the breeding season.},

  abstract = {Despite attempts at reconciliation, the role of omnivory in food web stability                     remains unclear. Here we develop a novel community matrix approach that is                     analogous to the bifurcation method of modular food web theory to show that the                     stability of omnivorous food chains depends critically on interaction strength.                     We find that there are only six possible ways that omnivorous interaction                     strengths can influence the stability of linear food chains. The results from                     these six cases suggest that: (1) strong omnivory is always destabilizing, (2)                     stabilization by weak to intermediate omnivorous interaction strengths dominates                     the set of possible stability responses, and, (3) omnivory can be occasionally                     strictly destabilizing or intermittently destabilizing. We then revisit the                     classical results of Pimm and Lawton to show that although their                     parameterization tends to produce a low percentage of stable omnivorous webs,                     the same parameterization shows strong theoretical support for the weak                     interaction effect. Finally, we end by arguing that our current empirical                     knowledge of omnivory resonates with this general theory.},

  abstract = {Marine coastal ecosystems are among the most exposed to global environmental change, with reported effects on species biomass, species richness and length of trophic chains. By combining a biologically informed food-web model with information on anthropogenic influences in 701 sites across the Caribbean region, we show that fishing effort, human density and thermal stress anomaly are associated with a decrease in local food-web persistence. The conservation status of the site, in turn, is associated with an increase in food-web persistence. Some of these associations are explained through effects on food-web structure and total community biomass. Our results unveil a hidden footprint of human activities. Even when food webs may seem healthy in terms of the presence and abundance of their constituent species, they may be losing the capacity to withstand further environmental degradation.},

  abstract = {The networks that form natural, social, and technological systems are vulnerable to the spreading impacts of perturbations. Theory predicts that networks with a clustered or modular structure—where nodes within a module interact more frequently than they do with nodes in other modules—might contain a perturbation, preventing it from spreading to the entire network. Gilarranz et al. conducted experiments with networked populations of springtail (Folsomia candida) microarthropods to show that modularity limits the impact of a local extinction on neighboring nodes (see the Perspective by Sales-Pardo). In networks with high modularity, the perturbation was contained within the targeted module, and its impact did not spread to nodes beyond it. However, simulations revealed that modularity is beneficial to the network only when perturbations are present; otherwise, it hinders population growth.Science, this issue p. 199; see also p. 128Networks with a modular structure are expected to have a lower risk of global failure. However, this theoretical result has remained untested until now. We used an experimental microarthropod metapopulation to test the effect of modularity on the response to perturbation. We perturbed one local population and measured the spread of the impact of this perturbation, both within and between modules. Our results show the buffering capacity of modular networks. To assess the generality of our findings, we then analyzed a dynamical model of our system. We show that in the absence of perturbations, modularity is negatively correlated with metapopulation size. However, even when a small local perturbation occurs, this negative effect is offset by a buffering effect that protects the majority of the nodes from the perturbation.},

Analysis reveals harvesting high population biomass species can initially support fishery persistence, but threatens long term economic and ecological sustainability by indirectly inducing extinction cascades in non-harvested species. This dynamic is exacerbated in open access fisheries where profit driven growth in fishing effort increases perturbation strength.

  abstract = {An extensive series of high-resolution satellite images from the advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and the sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWIFS) was used in a synoptic oceanographic characterization of San Jorge Gulf (SJG, Argentine Patagonia), an area of great significance for marine conservation and commercial fishing. Remotely sensed information was combined with on-board observer's data and published information to investigate the role of distinctive oceanographic features in relation to the life cycle of the Patagonian red shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri), main target of the industrial fleet in SJG. Three frontal systems—North, South and Outer SJG—are characterized. The North and South SJG fronts are associated with shrimp reproductive aggregations during late spring and summer. While both function as spawning/nursery grounds, they differ from each other in many respects. The thermohaline South SJG front has its maximum expression during the winter, reflecting the influence of the low-salinity Magellanic Plume, while the thermal North SJG front develops during spring and summer as the water column becomes stratified in the central basin of the gulf. Wind-related down-welling inshore of the front prevails in the North SJG, and upwelling in the South SJG frontal area. Chlorophyll a is concentrated near the thermocline on the stratified side of the North SJG, and for that reason, it is not detected by remote sensors during the spring bloom and the summer but becomes apparent offshore from the location of the front when the thermocline deepens during the fall (May). In the South SJG front, Chl-a concentration is apparent inshore from the front all year-round, related in part to upwelling-mediated resuspension. The northern end of the outer front coincides in time and space with a recurrent non-reproductive aggregation of red shrimp between November and January and is presumably related to foraging. It is argued that keeping the North and South SJG frontal systems off-limits to fishing is a central precautionary requisite for the sustainability of the shrimp fishery.},

Both overlap spatially and temporally. The San Jorge Gulf hake fishery consists of a high-seas ice trawler fleet (n = 20 fishing vessels) and a coastal fleet (n = 30 fishing vessels). These fisheries capture about 10\% of the catch of the southern hake stock. The Argentine red shrimp fishery consists of a double-beam trawler fleet with 80 freezer vessels, responsible for more than 75\% of shrimp landings in Argentina. The main problem of both fisheries is the bycatch of hake in one of its principle nursery areas. The present work describes the current management of the fisheries of San Jorge Gulf, which consists primarily of spatial and temporal closures for the Argentine red shrimp and zoning by stratum of the fleet for hake. Neither of these two fisheries has taken measures that effectively reduce bycatch.},

  abstract = {We studied discard use and incidental mortality of seabirds attracted to high-sea trawl vessels operating in the Golfo San Jorge, Argentina, during the height of the fishing season in 2003 and 2004. Fourteen seabird species ate food made available by fishing operations. The most frequent and abundant seabirds (percent occurrence, mean number per haul) were the kelp gull Larus dominicanus (98.9\%, 207.0), the black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophrys (98.9\%, 94.2) and the white-chinned petrel Procellaria aequinoctialis (91\%, 8.4). Flock sizes for the 3 species varied from a few to a maximum of 1600 birds. Total seabird abundance varied significantly between stages of the fishing operation, being higher during discarding and haulback than during towing. Incidental capture of seabirds in nets was recorded in 37\% of 89 hauls, with a mean capture rate of 1.2 birds per haul. Species incidentally caught were the great shearwater Puffinus gravis, the imperial cormorant Phalacrocorax atriceps and the Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus, with rates that varied between months and years. Considering the fishery’s fishing effort, the estimated total numbers of birds killed during the study were 2254 great shearwaters (CV = 1.1), 1233 imperial cormorants (CV = 1.1) and 35 Magellanic penguins (CV = 2.4) in 2003, and 311 imperial cormorants (CV = 1.7) and 1516 Magellanic penguins (CV = 1.1) in 2004. Black-browed albatrosses and kelp gulls were also struck by the warp cable while feeding on discards from the surface, and drowned when they were dragged underwater. The results obtained in this study show that the hake trawl fishery operating in the Golfo San Jorge may have a significant effect on some seabird populations through the provision of fishing discards and incidental mortality.},

The Kelp Gull and Black-browed Albatross were the most frequent and abundant seabirds at both fisheries, while Argentine Hake (Merluccius hubbsi) dominated the composition of discards. Kelp Gulls and Black-browed Albatrosses consumed 91\% of experimentally discarded hake (n~=~1236). Mean sizes of prey consumed by gulls were 22.4 and 23.7~cm in the hake and shrimp fisheries, respectively, while those of prey consumed by albatrosses were 28.5 and 31.3~cm, respectively. In both fisheries, gulls selected the smaller prey available ({$<$}25 and {$<~$}30~cm in hake and shrimp fisheries, respectively) while Black-browed Albatrosses selected the larger prey available ({$>$}25 and {$>$}30~cm in hake and shrimp fisheries, respectively). Intraspecific and interspecific kleptoparasitism were significantly more frequent than expected in Kelp Gulls and Black-browed Albatrosses, respectively. Robbing efficiency was clearly higher in albatrosses than gulls. In both species, sizes of prey consumed by direct capture were significantly smaller than those stolen, and the rate of kleptoparasitism increased with prey size. Gulls stole significantly smaller prey than albatrosses. Prey selection by Kelp Gulls is affected by the interaction with Black-browed Albatrosses, and the degree at which discards are used by both species appears to depend on the fishery considered, the food on offer and the selection of prey sizes according to seabird species-specific preferences.},

Los estudios de dieta son clave para evaluar la contribución relativa del descarte en su ecología trófica, así como empezar a comprender los potenciales efectos de la actividad pesquera sobre sus parámetros reproductivos y dinámica poblacional. El presente estudio analiza la composición dietaria de Gaviotas Cocineras (Larus dominicanus) que reproducen en la costa norte del Golfo San Jorge, Chubut, Argentina, durante la temporada de cría de 2007 en tres localidades de reproducción: Isla Vernacci Sudoeste (45°11’S, 66°31’O), Isla Felipe (45°04’S, 66°19’O) e Isla Laguna (45°02’S, 65°53’O). A su vez se seleccionaron tres períodos de muestreo: incubación, pichones pequeños y pichones grandes. Las muestras de dieta se obtuvieron mediante lavado estomacal. Los resultados obtenidos en las tres colonias analizadas confirman que en las costas del norte de Patagonia la Gaviota Cocinera es una especie generalista y oportunista que durante la temporada reproductiva se alimenta de una amplia variedad de presas, principalmente de peces e invertebrados marinos. Durante la etapa de pichones grandes, la frecuencia de ocurrencia de peces se incrementó mientras que la de poliquetos disminuyó. Los peces fueron las presas más frecuentes en el Golfo San Jorge, representados mayormente por la merluza común (Merluccius hubbsi), una especie de hábitos demersales, y que por lo tanto se encuentra, en general, inaccesible para un depredador de superficie como la Gaviota Cocinera. Es altamente probable que las merluzas comunes provengan mayormente del descarte pesquero. Futuros estudios deberían evaluar los patrones espacio‐temporales en la distribución de las embarcaciones pesqueras y su relación con la proporción de descartes pesqueros en la dieta de las Gaviotas Cocineras.Abstract~∙~Importance of fishery discards in the diet of Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus) at Golfo San Jorge, Patagonia The consumption of fishery discards at sea is currently an important component in the feeding ecology of many gull species. Diet studies are key to assess the relative contribution of discards in their trophic ecology, and to start to understand the potential effects of fishing activities on their breeding parameters and population dynamics. The present study analyzes the dietary composition of Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus) breeding on the northern coast of Golfo San Jorge, Chubut, Argentina, during the 2007 breeding season in three sites: Isla Vernacci Sudoeste (45°11’S, 66°31’O), Isla Felipe (45°04’S, 66°19’O) and Isla Laguna (45°02’S, 65°53’O). Three sampling periods were selected: incubation, small chicks and large chicks. Diet samples were obtained through stomach flushing. The results obtained in the three colonies analyzed confirm that on the northern Patagonian coast the Kelp Gull is a generalist and opportunistic species that feeds during the breeding season on a wide variety of prey, mainly fish and marine invertebrates. During the large chick stage, frequency of occurrence of fish increased while that of polychaetes decreased. Fish were the most frequent prey in the Golfo San Jorge, represented mainly by the Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi), a demersal species that is in general inaccessible for surface predators like the Kelp Gull. It is highly likely that Argentine hake consumed by Kelp Gulls comes mainly from fishing discards. Future studies should evaluate spatio‐temporal patterns in the distribution of fishing vessels and their relation with the proportion of fishery discards in Kelp Gull diet.},

  abstract = {In food webs, many interacting species coexist despite the restrictions imposed by the competitive exclusion principle and apparent competition. For the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations, sustainable coexistence necessitates nonzero determinant of the interaction matrix. Here we show that this requirement is equivalent to demanding that each species be part of a non-overlapping pairing, which substantially constrains the food web structure. We demonstrate that a stable food web can always be obtained if a non-overlapping pairing exists. If it does not, the matrix rank can be used to quantify the lack of niches, corresponding to unpaired species. For the species richness at each trophic level, we derive the food web assembly rules, which specify sustainable combinations. In neighboring levels, these rules allow the higher level to avert competitive exclusion at the lower, thereby incorporating apparent competition. In agreement with data, the assembly rules predict high species numbers at intermediate levels and thinning at the top and bottom. Using comprehensive food web data, we demonstrate how omnivores or parasites with hosts at multiple trophic levels can loosen the constraints and help obtain coexistence in food webs. Hence, omnivory may be the glue that keeps communities intact even under extinction or ecological release of species.},

  abstract = {We studied the diet of breeding Olrog's Gulls Larus atlanticus during 1994 at two colonies in Golfo San Jorge, Argentina, through the analysis of 207 regurgitated pellets. The diet at Isla Felipe and Isla Vernaci Sudoeste comprised only a few items (9 vs 7 respectively), of which crabs were the main component. At Isla Felipe, the crabs Cyrtograpsus altimanus and C. angulatus were present in 91.2\% and 89.2\% of pellets, respectively, while the percentage contribution of each species was 76.1\% and 21.7\%, respectively. At Isla Vernaci Sudoeste, the figures were similar (96.2\% and 80\% of pellets, and percentage contributions 79.4\% and 19.5\%). All other taxa were present in less than 11\% of pellets. No significant differences were found between colonies in the number of prey items, prey individuals per pellet, and consumption of crabs. Percentage contribution of crabs differed significantly between stages of the breeding cycle at Isla Felipe but not at Isla Vernaci Sudoeste. At both colonies, the proportion of male C. altimanus in pellets was larger than that of females. The proportion of female C. angulatus in pellets at Isla Vernaci Sudoeste was larger than that of males, but no significant differences were found in the consumption of each sex at Isla Felipe. Mean maximum carapace width of male crabs in pellets was not significantly different from that of females at either Isla Felipe or Isla Vernaci. Our study at Golfo San Jorge confirms that Olrog's Gull is fairly specialized, feeding mainly on crabs during the breeding season.},

  abstract = {Bottom trawl fisheries are the most widespread source of anthropogenic physical disturbance to seabed habitats. Development of fisheries-, conservation- and ecosystem-based management strategies requires the selection of indicators of the impact of bottom trawling on the state of benthic biota. Many indicators have been proposed, but no rigorous test of a range of candidate indicators against nine commonly agreed criteria (concreteness, theoretical basis, public awareness, cost, measurement, historical data, sensitivity, responsiveness, specificity) has been performed. Here, we collated data from 41 studies that compared the benthic biota in trawled areas with those in control locations (that were either not trawled or trawled infrequently), examining seven potential indicators (numbers and biomass for individual taxa and whole communities, evenness, Shannon–Wiener diversity and species richness) to assess their performance against the set of nine criteria. The effects of trawling were stronger on whole-community numbers and biomass than for individual taxa. Species richness was also negatively affected by trawling but other measures of diversity were not. Community numbers and biomass met all criteria, taxa numbers and biomass and species richness satisfied most criteria, but evenness and Shannon–Wiener diversity did not respond to trawling and only met few criteria, and hence are not suitable state indicators of the effect of bottom trawling. Synthesis and applications. An evaluation of each candidate indicator against a commonly agreed suite of desirable properties coupled with the outputs of our meta-analysis showed that whole-community numbers of individuals and biomass are the most suitable indicators of bottom trawling impacts as they performed well on all criteria. Strengths of these indicators are that they respond strongly to trawling, relate directly to ecosystem functioning and are straightforward to measure. Evenness and Shannon–Wiener diversity are not responsive to trawling and unsuitable for the monitoring and assessment of bottom trawl impacts.},

  abstract = {The social dynamics of killer whales (Orcinus orca) that hunt marine mammals are apparently highly flexible, though strong individual associations do exist. The killer whales at Punta Norte offer an unusually detailed view of association patterns and foraging behaviour, and suggest a pattern of behaviour that optimizes hunting efficiency with exception only to strong associations between some individuals and the provisioning and training of offspring. The main points from this paper are as follows: First, hunting effort was concentrated where the capture rate was greatest. All pods selectively attacked the prey type for which they had the highest capture rate. The amount of southern sea lion prey captured was approximately equal to the estimated minimum energetic requirement for killer whales based on weight. Secondly, one whale in each pod did the majority of the hunting, and then provisioned the others in the pod. It was clear on numerous occasions that food was shared. A review of reported incidences of killer wales taking marine mammal prey suggests that it is common for a subset of the individuals in a pod to hunt. These results are discussed in the context of the evolution of foraging behaviour.},

Nitrogen stable isotopes (δ15N) provide a powerful tool to estimate TP but are limited by a pragmatic assumption that isotope discrimination is constant (change in δ15N between predator and prey, Δ15N = 3.4‰), resulting in an additive framework that omits known Δ15N variation. Through meta-analysis, we determine narrowing discrimination from an empirical linear relationship between experimental Δ15N and δ15N values of prey consumed. The resulting scaled Δ15N framework estimated reliable TPs of zooplanktivores to tertiary piscivores congruent with known feeding relationships that radically alters the conventional structure of marine food webs. Apex predator TP estimates were markedly higher than currently assumed by whole-ecosystem models, indicating perceived food webs have been truncated and species-interactions over simplified. The scaled Δ15N framework will greatly improve the accuracy of trophic estimates widely used in ecosystem-based management.},

  abstract = {Abstract A framework for the description and analysis of multilayer networks is established in statistical physics, and calls are increasing for their adoption by community ecologists. Multilayer networks in community ecology will allow space, time and multiple interaction types to be incorporated into species interaction networks. While the multilayer network framework is applicable to ecological questions, it is one thing to be able to describe ecological communities as multilayer networks and another for multilayer networks to actually prove useful for answering ecological questions. Importantly, documenting multilayer network structure requires substantially greater empirical investment than standard ecological networks. In response, we argue that this additional effort is worthwhile and describe a series of research lines where we expect multilayer networks will generate the greatest impact. Inter-layer edges are the key component that differentiate multilayer networks from standard ecological networks. Inter-layer edges join different networks?termed layers?together and represent ecological processes central to the species interactions studied (e.g., inter-layer edges representing movement for networks separated in space). Inter-layer edges may take a variety of forms, be species- or network-specific, and be measured with a large suite of empirical techniques. Additionally, the sheer size of ecological multilayer networks also requires some changes to empirical data collection around interaction quantification, collaborative efforts and collation in public databases. Network ecology has already touched on a wide swath of ecology and evolutionary biology. Because network stability and patterns of species linkage are the most developed areas of network ecology, they are a natural starting place for multilayer investigations. However, multilayer networks will also provide novel insights to niche partitioning, the connection between traits and species? interactions, and even the geographic mosaic of co-evolution. Synthesis. Multilayer networks provide a formal way to bring together the study of species interaction networks and the processes that influence them. However, describing inter-layer edges and the increasing amounts of data required represent challenges. The pay-off for added investment will be ecological networks that describe the composition and capture the dynamics of ecological communities more completely and, consequently, have greater power for understanding the patterns and processes that underpin diversity in ecological communities. A plain language summary is available for this article.},

Both colonies are located within the Patagonia Austral marine park, and commercial trawl fisheries operate in adjacent waters, thus knowledge of their food requirement is fundamental to assess potential conflicts and monitor interactions. We obtained stomach samples from 63 adult Imperial Cormorants during the chick-rearing period in 2014: 32 at Isla Arce and 31 at Isla Vernaci Este. We recorded 27 and 30 prey taxa in stomach samples at Isla Arce and Isla Vernaci Este, respectively, and at least 21 were common to both islands. Significant differences in diet composition in terms of importance by mass were found between young and old chick stages at Isla Arce but not at Isla Vernaci Este. Rock cod (Patagonotothen spp.) were dominant at Isla Vernaci Este during both chick stages (75.7\% and 86.5\%, respectively). At Isla Arce, rock cod, Argentine anchovy (Engraulis anchoita), and Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi) contributed similarly to their diet (26–33\%) during the young chick stage, whereas Argentine anchovy dominated during the old chick stage (76.6\%). Diet composition in terms of importance by mass was significantly different between colonies. Imperial Cormorant consumed benthic, demersal, and pelagic prey, confirming plasticity in feeding habits, but their contribution differed depending on the site and chick stage. Our results suggest that diet assessments and monitoring the potential interaction between Imperial Cormorant and fisheries should not be based on information from a single breeding stage or location, but requires the analysis of diet composition throughout the breeding cycle with a representative sampling of the 17 colonies within the marine park.},

This is essential for us to be able to predict, and eventually mitigate, the consequences of increasing environmental perturbations such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasions of exotic species. * 2Ecological networks can be subdivided into three broad types: ‘traditional’ food webs, mutualistic networks and host–parasitoid networks. There is a recent trend towards cross-comparisons among network types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed to phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of network configurations, such as compartments, allows us to explore the role of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic networks and host–parasitoid networks, and of body size in food webs. * 3Research into ecological networks has recently undergone a renaissance, leading to the production of a new catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved, and quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been unearthed and it is increasingly evident that it is the distribution of interaction strengths and the configuration of complexity, rather than just its magnitude, that governs network stability and structure. * 4Another significant advance is the growing recognition of the importance of individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all, occur between individuals. The new generation of high-quality networks is now enabling us to move away from describing networks based on species-averaged data and to start exploring patterns based on individuals. Such refinements will enable us to address more general ecological questions relating to foraging theory and the recent metabolic theory of ecology. * 5We conclude by suggesting a number of ‘dead ends’ and ‘fruitful avenues’ for future research into ecological networks.},

Trophy large-sized sharks of the Argentinean coast, the sand-tiger Carcharias taurus , the copper Carcharhinus brachyurus and the sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus are under intense sport and artisanal fishing since the 50's decade. However, the current and historical information for the assessment of its populations status is scarce. The aim of this work was to analyze the status of conservation of these species through the gathering of expert fishermen knowledge (FK) on semi-structured interviews. Abundance variation perception between the beginning and the end of fishermen careers revealed a critical status for the species study (means variation between -77 and -90 \%). Furthermore, a best day's catch analysis reinforce this result in the case of the sand tiger shark.

Actualmente una gran proporción de poblaciones se encuentran diezmadas y algunas especies son consideradas en peligro de extinción. Los tiburones de gran tamaño y de interés pesquero de la costa Argentina, el escalandrún Carcharias taurus , el bacota Carcharhinus brachyurus y el gatopardo Notorynchus cepedianus se encuentran bajo una intensa presión de pesca desde la década del 50. Sin embargo, la información actual o histórica sobre el estado de conservación de estas especies es muy escasa. El objetivo de este trabajo fue analizar el estado de conservación de estas especies a través de la colecta de conocimiento de pescadores expertos mediante entrevistas semi-estructuradas. La precepción de los pescadores sobre la variación en abundancia entre el principio de sus carreras y el final de las mismas, mostró un estado crítico de las especies de estudio (variación media entre -77 y -90\%). Además, un análisis sobre el mejor día de capturas revela un estado particularmente crítico para el eslandrún. El cazón Galeorhinus galeus fue incluido en este trabajo con el objetivo de contrastar los resultados de la percepción de los pescadores con información formal disponible basada en información de Captura por Unidad de Esfuerzo. En ambas fuentes de información, si bien no son comparables, se obtuvo una declinación del 80 \% en la abundancia. Adicionalmente, en este trabajo se recabo información sobre los patrones estacionales de ocurrencia de las especies (adultos y neonatos). El crítico estado de conservación de las especies de estudio requiere la aplicación de mediadas de manejo urgentes, especialmente para el escalandrún que podría extinguirse regionalmente antes de que reaccionen usuarios u organismos de manejo.},

We investigated habitat use, seasonal patterns of abundance and population structure of the broadnose sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus in the marine temperate environment of a northern Patagonian bay (Argentina). We expected N. cepedianus to exhibit strong seasonality in the bay driven by the seasonal occurrence of important marine mammal prey. However, an alternative or complementary hypothesis arose from the possibility that N. cepedianus uses the area seasonally as mating grounds. To explore these hypotheses, a suite of baited remote underwater video stations and catch per unit effort data indices were used to estimate the seasonal relative abundance of the species inside the bay. Reproductive hormone levels were measured to determine reproductive status and maturity stages of the population. Results indicated that N. cepedianus uses the bay year-round, showing a peak abundance during spring when individuals aggregate, likely for feeding and mating purposes. Male and female total lengths at maturity were 170 and 190 cm, respectively. Contrary to other studies in the Southwest Atlantic, population composition remained similar throughout the seasons, with adults dominating over juveniles, and adult females prevailing in the population at all times. Considering the historical abundance decline recently reported for the species, protection and enforcement within protected areas across the Southwest Atlantic must remain of high priority in government initiatives.},

Crustaceans, mainly Themisto gaudichaudii and, to a lesser extent, euphausiids were the most important components of the diet in both areas and years, although there were considerable geographical differences in the relative proportion of the main prey. In the Patagonian area, during summer and autumn of 1992, almost all squid preyed on crustaceans (percentage occurrence = 85.29\%), followed by squid (11.76\%) and fish (2.94\%). On the Bonaerensis shelf, during autumn and winter of 1991, crustaceans were most important by percentage occurrence (56.96\%), but fish and squid accounted for a large proportion of the diet (29.41\% and 13.62\% respectively). Myctophids were prevalent among the fish and cannibalism was on I. argentinus juveniles. Changes in diet composition with squid size demonstrated the opportunistic nature of I. argentinus feeding. Although large squids were able to catch large prey (fish, squid), they also fed on small crustaceans when available, especially in the Patagonian area. The relative abundance of different prey organisms probably determined the diet. In both areas and both years I. argentinus fed mostly during daylight hours, starting in the morning and reaching a maximum in the afternoon.

The most frequent preys found in three of the four cruises corresponded to amphipods, represented by a single species, the hyperiid Themisto gaudichaudii, that accounted for over 50\% of the food consumed. When depth of the catching area was beyond 100 m an increase in consumption of squid and fish by specimens above 20 cm ML was observed. No clear trends were found between the type of prey consumed and the time of catches or the degree of stomach repletion of the predator. The diet, of low diversity, showed that 56-62\% of the squids studied fed on a single type of prey.},

  abstract = {Abstract Models of complex systems with n components typically have order n2 parameters because each component can potentially interact with every other. When it is impractical to measure these parameters, one may choose random parameter values and study the emergent statistical properties at the system level. Many influential results in theoretical ecology have been derived from two key assumptions: that species interact with random partners at random intensities and that intraspecific competition is comparable between species. Under these assumptions, community dynamics can be described by a community matrix that is often amenable to mathematical analysis. We combine empirical data with mathematical theory to show that both of these assumptions lead to results that must be interpreted with caution. We examine 21 empirically derived community matrices constructed using three established, independent methods. The empirically derived systems are more stable by orders of magnitude than results from random matrices. This consistent disparity is not explained by existing results on predator-prey interactions. We investigate the key properties of empirical community matrices that distinguish them from random matrices. We show that network topology is less important than the relationship between a species’ trophic position within the food web and its interaction strengths. We identify key features of empirical networks that must be preserved if random matrix models are to capture the features of real ecosystems.},

  abstract = {We review the effects of fishing on benthic fauna, habitat, diversity, community structure and trophic interactions in tropical, temperate and polar marine environments and consider whether it is possible to predict or manage fishing-induced changes in marine ecosystems. Such considerations are timely given the disillusionment with some fishery management strategies and that policy makers need a scientific basis for deciding whether they should respond to social, economic and political demands for instituting or preventing ecosystem-based management. Fishing has significant direct and indirect effects on habitat, and on the diversity, structure and productivity of benthic communities. These effects are most readily identified and last longest in those areas that experience infrequent natural disturbance. The initiation of fishing in an unfished system leads to dramatic changes in fish community structure. As fishing intensity increases the additional effects are more difficult to detect. Fishing has accelerated and magnified natural declines in the abundance of many forage fishes and this has lead to reduced reproductive success and abundance in birds and marine mammals. However, such donor-controlled dynamics are less apparent in food webs where fishes are the top predators since their feeding strategies are rather more plastic than those of most birds and mammals. Fishers tend to target species in sequence as a fishery develops and this leads to changes in the composition of the fished communities with time. The dramatic and apparently compensatory shifts in the biomass of different species in many fished ecosystems have often been driven by environmental change rather than the indirect effects of fishing. Indeed, in most pelagic systems, species replacements would have occurred, albeit less rapidly, in the absence of fishing pressure. In those cases when predator or prey species fill a key role, fishing can have dramatic indirect effects on community structure. Thus fishing has shifted some coral reef ecosystems to alternate stable states because there is tight predator–prey coupling between invertebrate feeding fishes and sea urchins. Fishing has reduced, and locally extirpated, populations of predatory fishes. These reductions do not have a consistent effect on the abundance and diversity of their prey: environmental processes control prey populations in some systems, whereas top-down processes are more important in others. By-catch which is discarded during fishing activities may sustain populations of scavenging species, particularly seabirds. We conclude by identifying the circumstances in which new research is needed to guide managers and stress the importance of unfished control sites for studies of fishing effects. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of closed area management (marine reserves) and the conditions under which such management is likely to provide benefits for the fishery or ecosystem.}

  abstract = {. Fishing has wide-ranging impacts on marine ecosystems. One of the most pervasive signs of intensive fishing is "fishing down the food web", with landings increasingly dominated by smaller species from lower trophic levels. Decreases in the trophic level of landings are assumed to reflect those in fish communities, because size-selective mortality causes decreases in the relative abundance of larger species and in mean body size within species. However, existing analyses of fishing impacts on the trophic level of fish communities have focused on the role of changes in species composition rather than size composition. This will provide a biased assessment of the magnitude of fishing impacts, because fishes feed at different trophic levels as they grow. Here, we combine body size versus trophic level relationships for North Sea fishes (trophic level assessed using nitrogen stable-isotope analysis) with species–size–abundance data from two time-series of trawl-survey data (whole North Sea 1982–2000, central and northern North Sea 1925–1996) to predict long-term trends in the trophic structure of the North Sea fish community. Analyses of the 1982–2000 time-series showed that there was a slow but progressive decline in the trophic level of the demersal community, while there was no trend in the trophic level of the combined pelagic and demersal community. Analyses of the longer time-series suggested that there was no trend in the trophic level of the demersal community. We related temporal changes in trophic level to temporal changes in the slopes of normalised biomass size-spectra (which theoretically represent the trophic structure of the community), mean log2 body mass and mean log2 maximum body mass. While the size-based metrics of community structure showed long-term trends that were consistent with the effects of increased fishery exploitation, these trends were only correlated with trophic level for the demersal community. Our analysis suggests that the effects of fishing on the trophic structure of fish communities can be much more complex than previously assumed. This is a consequence of sampled communities not reflecting all the pathways of energy transfer in a marine ecosystem and of the absence of historical data on temporal and spatial changes in the trophic level of individuals. For the North Sea fish community, changes in size structure due to the differential effects of fishing on species and populations with different life histories are a stronger and more universal indicator of fishing effects than changes in mean trophic level.},

  abstract = {Fishing affects patterns of energy use in fish populations, as demonstrated by changes in population energy consumption and the size and age when energy demands are greatest. We compare theoretical predictions and observed patterns of energy use (expressed as the primary production required to support fish production) by North Sea fish, based on simple and widely applicable theory that links life history parameters, fishing mortality (F), trophic transfer efficiency and relationships between size and trophic level (as determined using nitrogen stable isotope analysis). For the demersal species that dominate total biomass, relationships between size and trophic level were quite consistent among years. There were large decreases in relative energy requirements of all exploited demersal populations except plaice Pleuronectes platessa during the last 3 to 4~decades. Relative energy requirements of plaice were more stable because smaller plaice, which now dominate the exploited population, feed at higher trophic levels than larger plaice. The sizes and ages when population energy demands were greatest fell with increasing fishing mortality and differences between the predicted (F=0) and observed ages at maximum energy demand were greater in larger species. Currently, the energy demands of most species peak early in life (1–3~years) and largely reflect patterns of recruitment, leading to a homogenisation of the trophodynamics of the fish community. The fate of energy that is no longer used by commercially exploited species is not clear, partly because of the infrequent and untargeted monitoring of species that are more resilient to fishing. However, we conducted a preliminary assessment of the energy demands of solenette Buglossidium luteum, a very abundant small flatfish in the central North Sea that has increased in abundance in recent years. The solenette's high abundance and resilience to fishing, suggests that it now requires 35\% of primary production in part of the central North Sea, energy that may have supported larger species in a less heavily fished ecosystem.},

Both theory and simulations of current models predict the onset of instability with growing size and complexity, so for decades it has been conjectured that ecosystems must have some unidentified structural property exempting them from this outcome. We show that trophic coherence—a hitherto ignored feature of food webs that current structural models fail to reproduce—is a better statistical predictor of linear stability than size or complexity. Furthermore, we prove that a maximally coherent network with constant interaction strengths will always be linearly stable. We also propose a simple model that, by correctly capturing the trophic coherence of food webs, accurately reproduces their stability and other basic structural features. Most remarkably, our model shows that stability can increase with size and complexity. This suggests a key to May’s paradox, and a range of opportunities and concerns for biodiversity conservation.},

  abstract = {Sexual segregation in feeding strategies has been widely reported in seabirds. Most seabirds occupy wide breeding distributional ranges, and dissimilar ecological settings may result in distinct environmental pressures on males and females leading to geographical differences in sexual segregation. Using GPS loggers and stable isotope analysis of whole blood (δ15N, δ13C), we assessed the occurrence of sexual differences in Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus) foraging trip parameters, habitat use, isotopic niche and diet during the incubation period at three breeding locations in Argentina characterized by different foraging contexts. At Islote Arroyo Jabalí Este, sexual differences were found in trip parameters and habitat use mainly associated with a significantly higher use by males of a refuse dump as foraging site. However, their isotopic niches were similar with both sexes consuming mostly recreational fish waste, suggesting it was mainly obtained by males at the dump and by females at shoreline areas used by fishers. At Punta Tombo, there were no sex differences in trip parameters nor in the main prey consumed consisting of fishery discards, although females used more shoreline areas and males presented a significantly larger isotopic niche width. In contrast, at Isla Vernaci Este, males and females showed similar trip parameters, habitat use, and isotopic niche width and diet composition. Results show geographical differences in the degree of sexual segregation, which may result from differences in the availability of local food resources, particularly anthropogenic food subsidies.},

Our results suggest that non-trophic interactions exhibit highly nonrandom structures both alone and with respect to food web structure. The occurrence of different types of interactions, relative to all possible links, was well predicted by trophic structure and simple traits of the source and target species. In this community, competition for space and positive interactions related to habitat/refuge provisioning by sessile and/or basal species were by far the most abundant non-trophic interactions. If these patterns are corroborated in other ecosystems, they may suggest potentially important dynamic constraints on the combined architecture of trophic and non-trophic interactions.

We have, nonetheless, lacked both the data and the tools to more rigorously understand the patterning of multiple interaction types between species (i.e., “multiplex networks”), as well as their consequences for community dynamics. Using network statistical modeling applied to a comprehensive ecological network, which includes trophic and diverse non-trophic links, we provide a first glimpse at what the full “entangled bank” of species looks like. The community exhibits clear multidimensional structure, which is taxonomically coherent and broadly predictable from species traits.

  abstract = {The comparative analysis of the food habits between top predator allows the evaluation of how  these species use the trophic resources. They also make possible the study of potentially competitive  relationships and the role of these predators in the regulation and structure of the community. The marine  community of northern and central Patagonia is structured on the tri-trophic system composed by the  Argentine anchovy (Engraulis anchoita), the Argentine shortfin squid (Illex argentinus), and Argentine  hake (Merluccius hubbsi). Several marine mammals and elasmobranchs use these species as food  resources. For this reason, the objective of this work was to analyze comparatively the diet of the South  American sea lion (Otaria flavescens), the dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), the Commerson’s  dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii), the beaked skate (Raja flavirostris), the spiny dogfish (Squalus  acanthias) and the school shark (Galeorhinus galeus).  The diet of these predators was studied by stomach content analysis. The prey remains found in the  contents (fish bones and otoliths, cephalopod beaks, crustacean exoskeletons, etc.) were used to identify  and quantify the preys. The length and weight of prey at the moment of the ingestion were estimated by  alometric regressions.  The relative importance of prey species was evaluated by the relative importance index  IRI=(PH\%+N\%)FO\%, where PH\% is the percent in wet weight, N\% is the percent in number, and FO\% is  the frequency of occurrence of the prey species in the diet. This index was relativized to 100\% (IRI\%).  Intraspecific differences in diet allow the determination of trophospecies within a biological species.  These differences were evaluated using the general overlap (GO) and the specific overlap (SO) index.  These index were calculated using the occurrences of those prey species which had IRI\% values greater  than 1\% in the total sample of the biological species. Differences in the sizes consumed by the  trophospecies were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney test or the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric one way  ANOVA and paired comparisons.  The diet of the South American sea lion was studied using samples obtained from animals found  dead on the beach and incidentally caught by the fishery. Forty-one prey species were identified from the  59 stomachs analyzed. The most important prey were the Argentine hake, the red octopus (Enteroctopus  megalocyathus), the raneya (Raneya brasiliensis), the Patagonian squid (Loligo gahi), and the Argentine  anchovy. The differences in the diet associated with the source of sampling (dead on beach or entangled)  and sex were evaluated using the GO and SO. Only differences between sexes were found.  The dusky dolphin diet was studied from a sample of 25 dolphins. Most of this sample was obtained  from incidental catches in nocturnal midwater hauls directed to the capture of Argentine red shrimp  (Pleoticus muelleri). Intraspecific differences in the diet were not analyzed due the small sample size.  The diet of the beaked skate was studied from a sample of 274 individuals obtained from the  incidental catches of the hake fishery. The most important prey were the Argentine hake, the Southern cod  (Patagonotothen ramsayi), the Argentine shortfin squid, the isopod (Serolis schythei), the raneya, and the  Argentine anchovy. A total of 45 prey species were identified. The overlap analysis indicated no  differences in the diet between sexes, but significant differences in the diet between immature and mature  individuals.  The diet of the spiny dogfish was studied from a sample of 132 individuals obtained from the  incidental catches of the hake fishery between 1996 and 1998. The food habits were analyzed taking into  account the potential differences in diet related to sex and maturity condition. Using the GO and SO index,  differences in diet were found between immature individuals (SAinm), mature males (SAmm) and mature  females (SAhm).  The diet of the Commerson’s dolphin was studied from 9 stomach contents obtained from  incidentally caught individuals. Even that this sample is small and only allows a preliminary analysis, the  Argentine hake and the Argentine shortfin squid were the most important prey species. The sizes of prey  indicate that the Commerson’s dolphin fed on primary juveniles of hake and small juveniles of squid.  Then, it is reasonable to consider that this species, in the north and central Patagonia, is a pelagic predator  which feed on pelagic species or pelagic stages of species which exhibit schooling behavior.  The diet of the school shark was analyzed from 23 stomach contents obtained from individuals  incidentally caught in commercial hauls. The most important prey were the Argentine hake, the Argentine  shortfin squid and the red octopus, followed by the Southern cod and the Patagonian squid. Considering  the ecological groups of the prey, the school shark fed mostly on demersal-pelagic and benthic species,  suggesting that this predator feeds associated to the bottom. The sizes of the prey suggest that the school  shark consume its prey according to their environmental availability.  The inter-specific comparative diet analysis was made using the IRI\%, calculated for prey species  and ecological groups of prey. Considering the previous results and the sample sizes, the predator species  were divided in trophospecies. These trophospecies were the males (OFm) and females (OFh) of the South  American sea lion, the dusky dolphin (LO), the immature (RFinm) and mature (RFmad) individuals of the  beaked skate, the immature (SAinm), mature males (SAmm) and mature females (SAhm) of the spiny  dogfish, the Commerson’s dolphin (CC) and the school shark (GG).  In order to determine if the sample size of each trophospecies was representative of the putative  population, the Pielou’s pooled quadrat method and the Brillouin’s diversity index were employed. Also,  this procedure was used to estimate the population trophic diversity (Hp) for each trophospecies. The Hp  were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test and paired comparisons. Additionally, two cluster analysis  were performed using the IRI\% for the prey species and the ecological groups of prey. The results indicate  that all the sample sizes were representative of the populations, with the exception of the CC sample. For  this reason, this species was excluded from the analysis. A gradient of Hp was detected, where OFh and  LO were the trophospecies which showed the maximum and minimum values for Hp respectively. This  gradient was positively correlated with the IRI\% of the benthic and demersal-benthic prey. It suggests that  the trophic diversity is reflecting the biological diversity of the environments where the trophospecies are  feeding. Moreover, this result indicates that all these predators could be considered as generalist and  opportunistic in the context of the environmental patch that they use as trophic habitat.  Considering the cluster analysis based on the IRI\% of the ecological groups of prey, three groups  were identified. These groups were related to the consumption of demersal-pelagic preys (OFm, RFmad,  SAmm, SAhm and GG), the high importance of pelagic preys (SAinm and LO), and the high importance  of demersal-benthic preys (OFh and RFinm).  Considering the IRI\% of the prey species, the cluster analysis allowed the identification of 6 groups  of predators. The “OFm and RFmad” group was characterized by the high importance of Argentine hake  in the diet. The “GG” group was characterized by a relatively even distribution of the importance of  Argentine hake, Argentine shortfin squid, and red octopus. The “RFinm” group presented high importance  of Southern cod, followed by Argentine hake and isopods. The “SAinm, SAmm and SAhm” was related to  the high importance of Argentine shortfin squid and the presence of ctenophores. The “LO” group was  defined by the high importance of Argentine anchovy, followed by Argentine shortfin squid and  Patagonian squid. The “OFh” group was defined by the high importance of red octopus in the diet.  The overlap analysis between trophospecies indicated that the overlaps were low, and always  significantly different to the complete overlap. Then, these top predators will used the same, abundant and  frequent, trophic resources, but in different ways according to their trophic habitats. These differential  uses of the food resources lead to a separation of their trophic niches and to reduce the possibility of  ecological competition between them.},

  abstract = {Food habits of the South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) off Patagonia were studied by means of stomach content analysis. The samples were collected during 1982–1987 and 1990–1998 in northern and central Patagonia. The samples (n=59) came from individuals found dead on beaches and from animals recovered in incidental catches of the fi shery. Forty-one prey species (including fishes, cephalopods, crustaceans, gastropods, polychetes, sponges, and tunicates) were identified; most important were Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi), red octopus (Enteroctopus megalocyathus), Argentine shortfi n squid (Illex argentinus), “raneya” (Raneya brasiliensis), Patagonian squid (Loligo gahi), and Argentine anchovy (Engraulis anchoita). Differences in diet were found between sexes but not between geographical area of sampling, period of sampling, or source of samples. Females fed mostly on ben-thic species, whereas males fed mostly on demersal-pelagic species. The difference in diet between sexes was associated with different feeding grounds or different home ranges and could be produced by different constraints in the feeding behavior of each sex. These different constraints and restrictions could lead females to feed in more coastal and shallower waters than those waters where males feed. Some of the important prey were commercial species (Argentine hake, Argentine shortfin squid, Patagonian squid) consumed at both commercial and noncommercial sizes by sea lions. The presence of gastroliths was independent of the presence of stomach parasites; however, gastrolith weight was positively correlated with individual sea lion’s length, indicating that gastroliths could be involved in buoyancy control. In summary, these stomach content analyses indicate that South American sea lions feed primarily on demersal and benthic species and, in general terms, use resources according to their environmental availability.},

Food habits were analyzed in relation to sex and maturity of sharks. Also, the relationship between diet and abundance of the main prey was explored. Intraspecific diet comparisons were performed. Differences in diet were found between immature individuals, mature males, and mature females. The Argentine shortfin squid Illex argentinus, the Argentine hake and ctenophores Pleurobrachia pileus were the most important prey for the spiny dogfish. Immature and small individuals were pelagic predators. After sexual maturity, the spiny dogfish shifted its diet. Mature and large individuals tended to reduce the consumption of ctenophores, and increase the consumption of demersal and benthic species. Previous diet studies on the spiny dogfish in 1984–1985 and 1994 indicated that the Argentine hake was the most important prey. In the present study, carried out in 1998, squid was the most important prey, followed by the hake. This diet change was related to the major decrease of hake due to overfishing and the increase of squid abundance between 1994 and 1999.},

  abstract = {Large‐scale patterns in species diversity and community composition are associated with environmental gradients, but the implications of these patterns for food‐web structure are still unclear. Here, we investigated how spatial patterns in food‐web structure are associated with environmental gradients in the Barents Sea, a highly productive shelf sea of the Arctic Ocean. We compared food webs from 25 subregions in the Barents Sea and examined spatial correlations among food‐web metrics, and between metrics and spatial variability in seawater temperature, bottom depth and number of days with ice cover. Several food‐web metrics were positively associated with seawater temperature: connectance, level of omnivory, clustering, cannibalism, and high variability in generalism, while other food‐web metrics such as modularity and vulnerability were positively associated with sea ice and negatively with temperature. Food‐web metrics positively associated with habitat heterogeneity were: number of species, link density, omnivory, path length, and trophic level. This finding suggests that habitat heterogeneity promotes food‐web complexity in terms of number of species and link density. Our analyses reveal that spatial variation in food‐web structure along the environmental gradients is partly related to species turnover. However the higher interaction turnover compared to species turnover along these gradients indicates a consistent modification of food‐web structure, implying that interacting species may co‐vary in space. In conclusion, our study shows how environmental heterogeneity, via environmental filtering, influences not only turnover in species composition, but also the structure of food webs over large spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Studying how food web structure and function varies through time represents an opportunity to better comprehend and anticipate ecosystem changes. Yet, temporal studies of highly resolved food web structure are scarce. With few exceptions, most temporal food web studies are either too simplified, preventing a detailed assessment of structural properties, or binary, missing the temporal dynamics of energy fluxes among species. Using long-term, multi-trophic biomass data coupled with highly resolved information on species feeding relationships, we analyzed food web dynamics in the Gulf of Riga (Baltic Sea) over more than three decades (1981-2014). We combined unweighted (topology-based) and weighted (biomass- and flux-based) food web approaches, first, to unravel how distinct descriptors can highlight differences (or similarities) in food web dynamics through time, and second, to compare temporal dynamics of food web structure and function. We find that food web descriptors vary substantially and distinctively through time, likely reflecting different underlying ecosystem processes. While node- and link-weighted metrics reflect changes related to alterations in species dominance and fluxes, unweighted metrics are more sensitive to changes in species and link richness. Comparing unweighted, topology-based metrics and flux-based functions further indicates that temporal changes in functions cannot be predicted using unweighted food web structure. Rather, information on species population dynamics and weighted, flux-based networks should be included to better comprehend temporal food web dynamics. By integrating unweighted, node- and link-weighted metrics, we here demonstrate how different approaches can be used to compare food web structure and function, and identify complementary patterns of change in temporal food web dynamics, which enables a more complete understanding of the ecological processes at play in ecosystems undergoing change.},

Warming strengthened trophic cascades from fish to primary producers, and it decreased the impact of eutrophication on the mean and temporal variation of phytoplankton biomass. These impacts varied seasonally, with higher temperatures leading to stronger trophic cascades in winter and weaker algae blooms under eutrophication in summer. Our results suggest that higher temperatures may shift the control of primary production in freshwater ponds toward stronger top-down and weaker bottom-up effects. The dampened temporal variability of algal biomass under eutrophication at higher temperatures suggests that warming may stabilize some ecosystem processes.},

  abstract = {Abstract 1 Models for predicting ecological behaviour typically require large volumes of data for parameterisation, which is a problem because data are scarce. Qualitative modelling (QM) provides an alternative by exploring the entire range of possible parameter values. When a parameter value is completely unknown, QM typically invokes the Principle of Indifference (PoI), for example by sampling the parameter from a uniform prior distribution However, if PoI is invoked in this probabilistic way, there may be multiple possible methods for defining a parameter space and sampling values from it, and, worryingly two different but equally defensible methods can lead to different predictions about ecosystem responses. 2 We investigated how probabilistic PoI can give rise to problems in QM, and developed an alternative method based on Boolean PoI that does not suffer the same limitations We used a case study that involved predicting the responses of multiple species to the suppression of a pest. The unknown model parameters were interaction strengths between species. For the standard probabilistic method, we drew the parameters randomly from uniform (PoI) and other distributions. For our new Boolean PoI method, we instead simply specified the ranges of ?possible? parameter values, and developed a Boolean analysis technique to summarise model predictions. 3 As expected, invoking probabilistic QM yielded diff erent predictions (species response probabilities) for different but equally defensible parameterisation and sampling schemes Sometimes differences were large enough to impact decision making. In contrast, our new Boolean PoI approach simply classifies outcomes (species responses) as certain, possible, or impossible. Encouragingly, some species responses that were not consistently resolved under probabilistic PoI were shown by our method to be in fact governed by simple rules. Our method can also identify key species whose responses determine whole-system outcomes. 4 Our non-probabilistic representation of uncertainty circumvents the philosophical problems in standard implementations of PoI for QM. Our Boolean analysis method summarises results in a way that is interpretable and potentially useful to conservation decision makers. A priority for future research is to increase the efficiency of our Boolean approach to allow it to deal with problems of higher complexity (more interactions).

This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.},

Nevertheless, our lives are strongly based on services provided by ecosystems, thus the responses to global change of our natural heritage are of immediate concern. Understanding the relationship between complexity and stability of ecosystems is of key importance for the maintenance of the balance of human growth and the conservation of all the natural services that ecosystems provide. Mathematical network models can be used to simplify the vast complexity of the real world, to formally describe and investigate ecological phenomena, and to understand ecosystems propensity of returning to its functioning regime after a stress or a perturbation. The use of ecological-network models to study the relationship between complexity and stability of natural ecosystems is the focus of this review. The concept of ecological networks and their characteristics are first introduced, followed by central and occasionally contrasting definitions of complexity and stability. The literature on the relationship between complexity and stability in different types of models and in real ecosystems is then reviewed, highlighting the theoretical debate and the lack of consensual agreement. The summary of the importance of this line of research for the successful management and conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services concludes the review.},

P. guntheri also had a moderately diverse zooplankton diet, especially copepods, and benthos and squid damaged by the fishery. The diet of P. tessellata was the most diverse and was mainly benthos, including damaged scallops, with some euphausiids and amphipods. Feeding niche overlap of fish between 10 and 20 cm TL for the three species was between 5.8 and 9.2\% for each pair of species, indicating relatively little overlap even though all species scavenged on organisms made available by the fishery. Thus the diet of these three Patagonotothen species indicates substantial feeding niche separation, and that the three species are moderately specialised feeders.},

  abstract = {Trophic enrichment factors (TEF) are essential to properly and fruitfully explore stable isotope analysis in ecology. And so is the time window of food source integration, usually estimated with the turnover rates (lambda) of isotopic incorporation. On the road to provide ecologists with a general and reliable method to obtain TEF and turnover rates for diet reconstruction, isotopists start realizing that those two parameters are ultimately linked with the physiological state of organisms and that metabolic pathways are of primary importance to understand the large ranges in TEF values. In this study, we used a diet-switching experiment for seven small marine invertebrates. Changes in isotopic compositions were fitted to an exponential decay model to estimate TEF and. values. We then partitioned the growth and the catabolism components of the turnover rate and tested how these components are correlated to the TEF among species. Results showed a significant linear negative relationship between TEF and growth values for both C and N. This ultimately means that the increase in body mass over a time window can be used to estimate the TEF values for a given species.},

However, the effects of over-fishing, environmental change, fish community dynamics and other factors that have altered the trophic ecology of cod are not well understood. We present an analysis of the trophic patterns of cod in the northeast US shelf ecosystem from a 25 yr time series of food habits data. Additionally, we compared the diet of this species with the spatio-temporal distribution of its prey species and evaluated prey preference over time. Atlantic cod exhibit an omnivorous diet; we assessed the temporal, spatial, and ontogenetic trends in this diet by examination of {$>$}15000 stomachs. Ontogenetic shifts in diet were observed; early juveniles consumed more pelagic than benthic invertebrates, medium cod consumed benthic invertebrates and fish, and larger cod consumed larger amounts of fish. Cannibalism also increased with ontogeny. Diet shifted significantly over a period of 3 decades, concurrent with changes in forage species abundance and distribution. Most of the major prey species were eaten in periods when they had high spatio-temporal overlap with cod and were abundant, indicating opportunistic feeding by cod. Similar to many other ecosystems, cod prefer sand lance, Cancer spp. crabs and herring, regardless of the abundance or spatio-temporal overlap with these prey species. It is unclear whether the observed changes in the trophic dynamics of cod have broad implications for cod populations, yet the evidence does suggest that cod are not likely to influence the abundance and distribution of their prey populations in this ecosystem.},

  abstract = {More recent and extensive food web studies have questioned some of the prevailing paradigms of food web theory. Yet with few exceptions, most food webs and associated metrics are reported for freshwater or terrestrial systems. I analyzed the food web of the Northeast US Shelf ecosystem across a large spatial and temporal extent. This speciose food web exhibits a predator:prey ratio (0.95) and percentage of intermediate species (89\%) similar to most other food webs. Other statistics, such as the percentage of omnivory (62\%), percentage of cannibalistic species (31\%), number of cycles (5\%), and the total number of links (L; 1562) and species (S; 81) are similar to more recent and extensively studied food webs. Finally, this food web exhibits a linkage density (L/S; 19.3), connectivity (C; 48.2\%), and Lyapunov stability proxy (S × C; 39.1) that are an order of magnitude higher than other webs or are disproportionate to the number of species observed in this system. Although the exact S and C relationship is contentious, the connectivity of food webs with more than 40 species is approximately 10\%, which is very different from the near 50\% observed for this ecosystem. The openness of marine ecosystems, lack of specialists, long lifespans, and large size changes across the life histories of many marine species can collectively make marine food webs more highly connected than their terrestrial and freshwater counterparts, contrary to food web theory. Changes in connectivity also have ramifications for ecosystem functioning and Lyapunov stability. The high connectivity of this food web and the mathematical determinants for stability are consistent with the weak nature of species interactions that have been observed and that are required for system persistence. Yet the historically high exploitation rates of marine organisms obfuscate our understanding of marine food web stability. It is possible that marine food webs are inherently very different from their terrestrial or freshwater counterparts, implying the need for modified paradigms of food web theory.},

  abstract = {P{$>$}1. Using a subtidal marine food web as a model system, we examined how food chain length (predators present or absent) and the prevalence of omnivory influenced temporal stability (and its components) of herbivores and plants. We held the density of top predators constant but manipulated their identity to generate a gradient in omnivory prevalence. 2. We measured temporal stability as the inverse of the coefficient of variation of abundance over time. Predators and omnivory could influence temporal stability through effects on abundance (the 'abundance' effect), summed variance across taxa (the 'portfolio effect') or summed covariances among taxa (the 'covariance effect'). 3. We found that increasing food chain length by predator addition destabilized aggregate herbivore abundance through their cascading effects on abundances. Thus, predators destabilized herbivores through the overyielding effect. We also found that the stability of herbivore abundance and microalgae declined with increasing prevalence of omnivory among top predators. Aggregate macroalgae was not affected, but the stability of one algal taxon increased with the prevalence of omnivory. 4. Our results suggest that herbivores are more sensitive than plants to changes in food web structure because of predator additions by invasion or deletions such as might occur via harvesting and habitat loss.},

  abstract = {The foraging ecology of the school shark Galeorhinus galeus was studied in Anegada Bay, Argentina, during the seasonal occurrence of this species in Argentinean waters (October to April) from 1998 to 2001. Of the 408 individuals examined, 168 (41.2\%) had food remains in their stomachs. The proportion of individuals with food remains was negatively correlated with total length. In general, the diet was composed mainly of teleosts (98.5\% IRI [index of relative importance]), with invertebrates and chondrichthyans as minor prey. The diet varied ontogenetically and seasonally. Juveniles and adults differed in their consumption of invertebrates, with juveniles preying more on benthic invertebrates, mainly the octopus Octopus tehuelchus, and adults on squid. From December to February, adults preyed mainly on benthic teleosts (almost exclusively the Atlantic midshipman Porichthys porosissimus), while from March to April the consumption of squid increased. A comparison of numbers of prey in stomachs with abundance of prey in the environment in March and April showed that, in these months, juveniles selected invertebrates and demersal teleosts and avoided pelagic teleosts and chondricthyan prey, and adults selected squid and avoided pelagic teleosts. This indicates that, during this period, G. galeus is not an opportunistic predator. The mean size of prey increased with increasing shark length, but even large sharks consumed small prey. All shark sizes consumed prey fragments that were significantly larger than other prey consumed whole. This indicates that G. galeus is able to overcome gape limitation by mutilating prey, and that the ontogenetic diet shift was not due to a change in the ability to seize prey.},

The niche width and feeding strategy displayed by B. macloviana support the specialisation towards polychaetes throughout this study. Slow motile and infaunal species constitute major preys.

  abstract = {Knowledge of the food web structure and complexity are central to better understand ecosystem functioning. A food-web approach includes both species and energy flows among them, providing a natural framework for characterizing species’ ecological roles and the mechanisms through which biodiversity influences ecosystem dynamics. Here we present for the first time a high-resolution food web for a marine ecosystem at Potter Cove (northern Antarctic Peninsula). Eleven food web properties were analyzed in order to document network complexity, structure and topology. We found a low linkage density (3.4), connectance (0.04) and omnivory percentage (45), as well as a short path length (1.8) and a low clustering coefficient (0.08). Furthermore, relating the structure of the food web to its dynamics, an exponential degree distribution (in- and out-links) was found. This suggests that the Potter Cove food web may be vulnerable if the most connected species became locally extinct. For two of the three more connected functional groups, competition overlap graphs imply high trophic interaction between demersal fish and niche specialization according to feeding strategies in amphipods. On the other hand, the prey overlap graph shows also that multiple energy pathways of carbon flux exist across benthic and pelagic habitats in the Potter Cove ecosystem. Although alternative food sources might add robustness to the web, network properties (low linkage density, connectance and omnivory) suggest fragility and potential trophic cascade effects.},

  abstract = {The search for general properties in network structure has been a central issue for food web studies in recent years. One such property is the small-world topology that combines a high clustering and a small distance between nodes of the network. This property may increase food web resilience but make them more sensitive to the extinction of connected species. Food web theory has been developed principally from freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, largely omitting marine habitats. If theory needs to be modified to accommodate observations from marine ecosystems, based on major differences in several topological characteristics is still on debate. Here we investigated if the small-world topology is a common structural pattern in marine food webs. We developed a novel, simple and statistically rigorous method to examine the largest set of complex marine food webs to date. More than half of the analyzed marine networks exhibited a similar or lower characteristic path length than the random expectation, whereas 39\% of the webs presented a significantly higher clustering than its random counterpart. Our method proved that 5 out of 28 networks fulfilled both features of the small-world topology: short path length and high clustering. This work represents the first rigorous analysis of the small-world topology and its associated features in high-quality marine networks. We conclude that such topology is a structural pattern that is not maximized in marine food webs; thus it is probably not an effective model to study robustness, stability and feasibility of marine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {At least 626 southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) calves died at the Península Valdés calving ground, Argentina, between 2003 and 2014. Intense gull harassment may have contributed to these deaths. In the 1970s, Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus) began feeding on skin and blubber pecked from the backs of living right whales at Valdés. The frequency of gull attacks has increased dramatically over the last three decades and mother-calf pairs are the primary targets. Pairs attacked by gulls spend less time nursing, resting and playing than pairs not under attack. In successive attacks, gulls open new lesions on the whales’ backs or enlarge preexisting ones. Increased wounding could potentially lead to dehydration, impaired thermoregulation, and energy loss to wound healing. The presence, number and total area of gull-inflicted lesions were assessed using aerial survey photographs of living mother-calf pairs in 1974–2011 (n = 2680) and stranding photographs of dead calves (n = 192) in 2003–2011. The percentage of living mothers and calves with gull lesions increased from an average of 2\% in the 1970s to 99\% in the 2000s. In the 1980s and 1990s, mothers and calves had roughly equal numbers of lesions (one to five), but by the 2000s, calves had more lesions (nine or more) covering a greater area of their backs compared to their mothers. Living mother-calf pairs and dead calves in Golfo Nuevo had more lesions than those in Golfo San José in the 2000s. The number and area of lesions increased with calf age during the calving season. Intensified Kelp Gull harassment at Península Valdés could be compromising calf health and thereby contributing to the high average rate of calf mortality observed in recent years, but it cannot explain the large year-to-year variance in calf deaths since 2000.},

Facing such a challenge, recent approaches that bridge community ecology and conservation planning can broaden the theoretical foundations of strategies aimed to ensure the resilience and functional diversity of marine food webs. We here summarize metrics used to describe patterns of ecological interactions that account for the overall community architecture, such as nestedness and modularity. In addition, we discuss approaches to characterize species topological roles within food webs in order to identify sets of interacting species that act as the backbone of marine biodiversity and ecosystem functions. We argue that combining empirical data and dynamic network modeling is key to foster the integrative understanding of ecological, evolutionary, and anthropogenic processes shaping marine food webs, which requires theoretical ecologists and practitioners to work together in long-term, system-level strategies to conserve marine biodiversity and improve the sustainability of fisheries.},

  abstract = {[This study uses a high-resolution model to characterize the seasonal variability of the oceanic circulation in the Gulf of San Jorge (Argentina). The time mean circulation is dominated by a cyclonic gyre bounded by a relatively strong coastal current and, on its offshore side, by the Patagonia Current. The gulf circulation varies significantly with season. Tidal mixing during the summer months generates baroclinic pressure gradients that allow development of a cyclonic gyre in the southern region. During winter, erosion of density gradients weakens the cyclonic tendency and a large anticyclonic gyre develops in the southern region. Atmospheric heat fluxes regulate the transition between summer and winter circulation patterns. Analysis of process-oriented experiments indicates that summer circulation is mainly driven by the interaction between tides and stratification while winter circulation is mainly driven by wind forcing. The mass exchanges between the gulf and the open shelf peak during the summer due to a larger onshore penetration of the Patagonia Current. During winter, these exchanges are very weak and remain largely confined to the northern portion of the gulf.]}

In 1973, Robert May addressed these questions in this classic book. May investigated the mathematical roots of population dynamics and argued-counter to most current biological thinking-that complex ecosystems in themselves do not lead to population stability. Stability and Complexity in Model Ecosystems played a key role in introducing nonlinear mathematical models and the study of deterministic chaos into ecology, a role chronicled in James Gleick's book Chaos . In the quarter century since its first publication, the book's message has grown in power. Nonlinear models are now at the center of ecological thinking, and current threats to biodiversity have made questions about the role of ecosystem complexity more crucial than ever. In a new introduction, the author addresses some of the changes that have swept biology and the biological world since the book's first publication.},

Although, early food web data appeared to verify this, recently many ecologists have found omnivory to be ubiquitous in food web data gathered at a high taxonomic resolution. In this paper, we re–investigate the role of omnivory in food webs using a non–equilibrium perspective. We find that the addition of omnivory to a simple food chain model (thus a simple food web) locally stabilizes the food web in a very complete way. First, non–equilibrium dynamics (e.g. chaos) tend to be eliminated or bounded further away from zero via period–doubling reversals invoked by the omnivorous trophic link. Second, food chains without interior attractors tend to gain a stable interior attractor with moderate amounts of omnivory.},

Myliobatis goodie is an eagle ray reported from South Carolina in the USA (35°N) to Santa Cuz, Argentina (44°S), however little is known about this species, which is considered data deficient by the IUCN. In order to create adequate management strategies for this species, biological information is sorely needed. The objective of this study was to describe the biology of the population of M. goodei and its relationships with season, sex and the geographic features of Anegada Bay, Argentina (from 39.96°S to 40.60°S and from 62.10°W to 62.46°W) in 2008. Specifically, the population structure of M. goodie was studied by sex, seasons and sites, its food habits by seasons and sites, and the reproductive biology by seasons and sex. The results show that M. goodei exhibits seasonal migrations. Young-of-the-year remain in the bay all year long, while adults enter during spring and summer. Juveniles in spring are likely to become first-time mating individuals that migrate into open sea at the end of summer. These individuals would return to give birth for the first time and mate for the second time during the next year at summer. Anegada Bay would then be a mating and nursery area for the species. M. goodei behave as a generalist feeder with a uniform diet composed mainly of bivalves. Seasonal differences in the diet found arise from differences in prey diversity between summer and spring. Spatial differences, however, arise from the different abundances of caprellids and bivalves. Trophic level was 3.2 and it constitutes the first reference for this species, characterizing it as a secondary consumer.},

Differently from previous studies, our analysis did not relied on randomized networks with specific a priori assumptions, which has been demonstrated to produce inconsistent patterns. We aimed to evaluate the interplay between population dynamics and food-web topology, and its consequences to module occurrences in complex food-webs. We evaluated 13 arrangements of three-species modules and 199 arrangements of four-species modules. For each module, we assembled, a corresponding Jacobian predation matrix, and evaluated the arrangements expected to persist after a disturbance in the equilibrium of the populations dynamics (local stability). Our general results were that (1) a limited set of stable arrangements occurs most frequently; (2) the omnivory module is the only three-species module expected to occur both in the stable and unstable region; (3) connectance and omnivory affects the proportion of stable modules; and (4) the type of ecosystem influence the proportion of stable modules. Further, we demonstrated that food-web topology and population dynamics influenced module occurrences in natural communities; presented a function for the ways that local stability increases the probability of module occurrence; and highlighted the use of omnivory degree to access the effect of feeding at more than one trophic level on food-web stability.},

Notably, ecological and evolutionary studies have revealed that reciprocal interactions such as predator–prey, competition and mutualism, are key drivers of community dynamics. However, there is an argument that many species interactions are asymmetric, where one species unilaterally affects another species (amensalism or commensalism). This raises the unanswered question of what is the role of unilateral interactions in community dynamics. Here I use a theoretical approach to demonstrate that unilateral interactions greatly enhance community stability. The results suggested that amensalism and commensalism were more stabilizing than symmetrical interactions, such as competition and mutualism, but they were less stabilizing than an asymmetric antagonistic interaction. A mix of unilateral interactions increased stability. Furthermore, in communities with all interaction types, unilateral interactions tended to increase stability. This study suggests that unilateral interactions play a major role in maintaining communities, underlining the need to further investigate their roles in ecosystem dynamics.},

  abstract = {We reconstructed the structure of a tropical marine food web and then analyzed it to evaluate how the trophic network could respond to anthropogenic pressures such as the removal of species by fisheries. To reconstruct the presence/absence of predator-prey interactions, we assembled detailed quantitative information from the scientific literature on the stomach contents of 80 predator species (elasmobranchs, teleosts and invertebrates) collected in the Golfo de Tortugas (Colombia) between 1990 and 2009. We tested three conceptual models of network structure (random, small-world, and scale-free), characterized by different system properties and tolerance to perturbations, to evaluate which one better fitted the reconstructed food web. Our results suggest that this network has small-world structure and scale-free properties. An impact on one species may therefore spread to many species through short interaction chains; only a few nodes with high centrality values would support the network structure. However, contrary to current theory, our analysis revealed no clear relationships between species with high centrality and the large-scale structural patterns observed in the network (small-world and scale-free properties). This observation indicates that ecosystem-based fisheries management should prioritize not only high-centrality species (e.g., shrimps, which furthermore are species of high commercial value in the area), but should also consider species with unique structural properties such as those with little or no topological redundancy such as large sharks. For this reason, top predator conservation needs more attention than currently received in fisheries management.},

A total of 539 scats analyzed indicated that the weakfish (Cynoscion guatucupa), the cutlasfish (Trichiurus lepturus), the anchoveta (Engraulis anchoita), the anchovy (Anchoa marinii), and cephalopods were the main prey consumed by these fur seals. Prey richness was higher during January. The diet of A. australis varied between years, apparently related to changes in prey availability. C. guatucupa and E. anchoita decreased while T. lepturus and cephalopods increased from 1996 to 1998. South American fur seals fed on fish ranging in length from 5.4 to 104.8 cm and from 0.7 to 629.9 g in wet mass. However, the mean mass of the main items was never more than 200 g. Observations suggests that A. australis is a trophic generalist with the potential to prey on a wide range of species, although most of the diet is comprised of relatively few species. Fur seals and artisan fisheries both took C. guatucupa, with fur seals taking younger individuals (1–2 yr) than artisan fisheries ({$>$} 3 yr).},

Here we analyse two Antarctic ecosystems for which the interaction strengths are obtained: (1) directly, from independently measured material fluxes, (2) for the complete ecosystem and (3) with a close match between species and ‘trophic groups’. We analyse the role of recycling, predation and competition and find that ecosystem stability can be estimated by the strengths of the shortest positive and negative predator-prey feedbacks in the network. We show the generality of our explanation with another 21 observed food webs, comparing random-type parameterisations of interaction strengths with empirical ones. Our results show how functional relationships dominate over average-network topology. They make clear that the classic complexity-instability paradox is essentially an artificial interaction-strength result.},

In the past decades, there has been a shift from focussing on determining the number of interactions to taking into account their relative strengths. The question is: How do the strengths of the interactions determine the stability of a community? Recently, a metric has been proposed which compares the stability of observed communities in terms of the strength of three- and two-link feedback loops (cycles of interaction strengths). However, it has also been suggested that we do not need to go beyond the pairwise structure of interactions to capture stability. Here, we directly compare the performance of the feedback and pairwise metrics. Using observed food-web structures, we show that the pairwise metric does not work as a comparator of stability and is many orders of magnitude away from the actual stability values. We argue that metrics based on pairwise-strength information cannot capture the complex organization of strong and weak links in a community, which is essential for system stability.},

We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

  abstract = {The San Matías Gulf (SMG) is a semi-enclosed ecosystem where the Argentine hake Merluccius hubbsi (AH) has been the main fishery resource since 1971. During the 20th century the South American sea lion Otaria flavescens (SASL) population was severely reduced in this ecosystem due an intense hunting, but in the 1970's conservation was promoted and hunting was banned. As a consequence SASL have been slowly recovering, until the 1990's when rapidly rebuilt their populations. Recent studies indicate that they feed mostly over commercially profitable medium-sized AH. Also, medium-sized and large hake are well-known cannibals that feed heavily over smaller AH. Fishing trawlers affect juvenile and medium-sized AH and artisanal long-liners capture exclusively large AH. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a growing SASL population over the AH in the SMG, considering the changes in the fishing activity as well as the size-structured cannibalism within the AH population. The evaluations were based on time series of hake and SASL biomass using the “Ecopath with Ecosim” dynamic modelling approach. The analyses show that over 4 decades the increase in Sea Lions biomass has not generated a significant increase in the predation mortality over AH. On the other hand, an increase and subsequent variations in the fishing mortality seems to be related with long-term variations in large AH abundance, and a decrease in medium-sized AH abundance, constraining the cannibalism mortality. This led to a positive effect over juvenile AH abundance due to a released cannibalism pressure, even considering that the less abundant larger AH are also the main spawners of the population. In this scenario, where it seems that trawlers and long-liners have replaced several predators over the SMG food web, SLAS population is still growing but they may not reach the pristine abundance levels of the time before hunting.},

  abstract = {Ecological communities are constantly being reshaped in the face of environmental change and anthropogenic pressures. Yet, how food webs change over time remains poorly understood. Food web science is characterized by a trade-off between complexity (in terms of the number of species and feeding links) and dynamics. Topological analysis can use complex, highly resolved empirical food web models to explore the architecture of feeding interactions but is limited to a static view, whereas ecosystem models can be dynamic but use highly aggregated food webs. Here, we explore the temporal dynamics of a highly resolved empirical food web over a time period of 18 years, using the German Bight fish and benthic epifauna community as our case study. We relied on long-term monitoring ecosystem surveys (from 1998 to 2015) to build a metaweb, i.e. the meta food web containing all species recorded over the time span of our study. We then combined time series of species abundances with topological network analysis to construct annual food web snapshots. We developed a new approach, ‘node-weighted’ food web metrics by including species abundances to represent the temporal dynamics of food web structure, focusing on generality and vulnerability. Our results suggest that structural food web properties change through time; however, binary food web structural properties may not be as temporally variable as the underlying changes in species composition. Further, the node-weighted metrics enabled us to detect that food web structure was influenced by changes in species composition during the first half of the time series and more strongly by changes in species dominance during the second half. Our results demonstrate how ecosystem surveys can be used to monitor temporal changes in food web structure, which are important ecosystem indicators for building marine management and conservation plans.},

Field observations confirmed that trawling reduced the density of important bioturbators in the study area, but revealed only weak effects of trawling on nutrient fluxes. The importance of the decline in bioturbators was demonstrated in the mesocosm experiments where the density of four key bioturbators (Brissopsis lyrifera, Nuculana minuta, Calocaris macandreae and Amphiura chiajei) showed significant correlations with nutrient flux. All four species caused an increase in the rate at which silicate was released from the sediment, but their effect on nitrogen cycling were species specific. Bioturbators that bulldoze through the sediment (B. lyrifera and N. minuta) increased the loss of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) from the sediment, whereas those that irrigate burrows within the sediment (C. macandreae and A. chiajei) caused increased uptake of DIN. This shows that the activities of the species present can determine whether the seabed acts as a source or a sink of nitrogen nutrients. By combining these experimental results with field observations of bioturbator abundances, we demonstrate the potential impacts of trawling on benthic ecosystem function. Due to the world-wide extent of intensive bottom-trawling, such effects may be globally significant and affect the nutrient balance especially in continental shelf and coastal areas.},

Individuals (n~=~291) were caught as by-catch by the bottom-trawl shrimp fishery and by coastal sport anglers in Central Patagonia (Southwestern Atlantic between 43° and 45° S). Results showed that M. schmitti is a mesocarnivorous with a mean trophic level of 3.58. The diet was based mostly on crustaceans (decapods, stomatopods, isopods and amphipods), polychaetes, fishes and cephalopods, in a decreasing order of importance. The diet varied between juveniles and adults, and between individuals captured by the trawling fishery and sport anglers. Crabs were the main prey item observed in the stomach of individuals caught by anglers while the shrimp Pleoticus muelleri was the most consumed prey by individuals caught as by-catch. Juveniles consumed more polychaetes than adults, while the latter consumed mostly shrimp. The presence of shrimp in stomach contents of M. schmitti caught by the commercial fishery is evidence of a trophic interaction between M. schmitti and the fishery. The interaction may be due to the shark and the fleet targeting the same resource, or due to the shark using the discarded shrimp as a food source.},

  abstract = {This contribution, which reviews some broad trends in human history and in the history of fishing, argues that sustainability, however defined, rarely if ever occurred as a result of an explicit policy, but as result of our inability to access a major part of exploited stocks. With the development of industrial fishing, and the resulting invasion of the refuges previously provided by distance and depth, our interactions with fisheries resources have come to resemble the wars of extermination that newly arrived hunters conducted 40 000–50 000 years ago in Australia, and 11 000–13 000 years ago against large terrestrial mammals arrived in North America. These broad trends are documented here through a map of change in fish sizes, which displays characteristic declines, first in the nearshore waters of industrialized countries of the Northern Hemisphere, then spread offshore and to the Southern Hemisphere. This geographical extension met its natural limit in the late 1980s, when the catches from newly accessed stocks ceased to compensate for the collapse in areas accessed earlier, hence leading to a gradual decline of global landing. These trends affect developing countries more than the developed world, which have been able to meet the shortfall by increasing imports from developing countries. These trends, however, together with the rapid growth of farming of carnivorous fishes, which consumes other fishes suited for human consumption, have led to serious food security issues. This promotes urgency to the implementation of the remedies traditionally proposed to alleviate overfishing (reduction of overcapacity, enforcement of conservative total allowable catches, etc.), and to the implementation of non–conventional approaches, notably the re–establishment of the refuges (also known as marine reserves), which made possible the apparent sustainability of pre–industrial fisheries.},

  abstract = {This timely book brings readers up to date on the wide range of advances made in fisheries science since the publication in 1957 of On the Dynamics of Exploited Fish Populations (Beverton and Holt), regarded by many fisheries scientists as one of the most important books on fisheries yet published. Traditional fishery subjects covered include historic declines and changes in fishing fleets, fisheries management and stock assessments, data-poor situations, simulation and modelling of fished stocks, fisheries economics, assessing reproductive potential and dispersal of larvae, fisheries for sharks and rays, and use of marine technology. Additionally, related subjects of increasing importance now that ecological approaches to management are coming to the fore are presented. They include benthic ecology, ecosystem changes linked to fishing, life history theory, the effects of chemicals on fish reproduction, and use of sounds in the sea by marine life. Several chapters offer stimulating philosophical discussion of the many controversial areas still existing. This significant book, edited by Andy Payne, John Cotter and Ted Potter and containing contributions by world-renowned fisheries scientists, including many based at Cefas (where Beverton and Holt's original work was carried out) is an essential purchase for fisheries managers and scientists, fish biologists, marine scientists and ecologists. Libraries in all universities and research establishments where fisheries and biological sciences are studied and taught are likely to need copies of this landmark publication.},

  abstract = {Food webs as representations of who eats whom are at the core of community ecology. Incorporation of tools from network theory enables assessment of how complex systems respond to natural and human-induced stressors, revealing how harvesting may degrade the properties and resilience of food webs. We present a comprehensive, coastal marine food web that includes 147 taxa co-occurring on shallow subtidal reefs along the highly productive and exploited Humboldt Current System of central Chile. This food web has connectance of 0.06, link density of 1204 and mean chain length of 4.3. The fractions of intermediate (76\%), omnivorous (49\%) and cannibalistic (8\%) nodes are slightly lower than those observed in other marine food webs. Of the 147 nodes, 34 are harvested. Links to harvested nodes represented 50 to 100\% of all trophic links of non-harvested nodes, illustrating the great impact that fishery pressure can have on the food web. The food web was compartmentalized into 5 sub-webs with high representation of harvested taxa. This structure changes if the fishery node is removed. Similarity analyses identified groups of harvested species with non-harvested nodes, suggesting that these tropho-equivalents could be sentinel species for the community-wide impacts of coastal fisheries. We conclude that fishing effects can be transmitted throughout the food web, with no compartments completely unaffected by harvesting. It is urgent to establish monitoring programs for community-wide effects of fisheries and assess whether resilience of these highly productive subtidal food webs has already been compromised, thereby identifying essential nodes that require stronger fisheries regulation.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Understanding which species might become extinct and the consequences of such loss is critical. One consequence is a cascade of further, secondary extinctions. While a significant amount is known about the types of communities and species that suffer secondary extinctions, little is known about the consequences of secondary extinctions for biodiversity. Here we examine the effect of these secondary extinctions on trophic diversity, the range of trophic roles played by the species in a community. Our analyses of natural and model food webs show that secondary extinctions cause loss of trophic diversity greater than that expected from chance, a result that is robust to variation in food web structure, distribution of interactions strengths, functional response, and adaptive foraging. Greater than expected loss of trophic diversity occurs because more trophically unique species are more vulnerable to secondary extinction. This is not a straightforward consequence of these species having few links with others but is a complex function of how direct and indirect interactions affect species persistence. A positive correlation between a species? extinction probability and the importance of its loss defines high?risk species and should make their conservation a priority.},

  abstract = {The stable isotope analysis (SIA) has been employed in several areas in Ecology and with different taxonomic groups. This tool has been very important in trophic ecology studies. The basic principle of the SIA is that the proportion of the stable isotopes of an element in an animal tissue could be related with its diet, and it is described by the discrimination factor (DF). The DF is one of the most important parameters in stable isotope analysis. Accurate estimates of the DF are extremely important because they are used in mixture models and to determine the species trophic level. The goals of this study were to quantify, by a scientometric analysis, the research that investigates the sources of variability of the discrimination factor, focusing in fishes. The results obtained were discussed and synthesized, as well the methods employed to estimate the DF. A survey in the ISI Web of Science was performed to find articles related to the theme. Most researches were led by the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany. Muscle was the tissue more commonly utilized. Recently, fin and scale have been used because both represent non-lethal samples. In addition to the use of ?13C and ?15N, interest in using ?D (deuterium) as a food web tracer has been applied in studies with fish. The type of diet, trophic group, metabolic and growth rate appeared to be important sources of variability. The compound-specific isotope analysis of amino acids offers an opportunity to reduce the variation related to the protein content. We believed that there is a need to investigate (i) DF in tropical areas, (ii) the effect of temperature in the DF, (iii) the variation of the DF in different trophic groups. It is recommended greater emphasis in the use of non-lethal samples.},

In some real food webs there seem to be no omnivores (Fig. 1a)5; in others omnivores are common6,7 (Fig. 1c)8.

The first component was used as a discriminant function to classify species. There is clear species differentiation in both size and shape of the statoliths. The statoliths of Loligo gahi are significantly larger than those of Loligo sanpaulensis. Loligo gahi statoliths are characterized by the presence of a prominent dorsal dome and a relatively long, thin rostrum, whereas those of Loligo sanpaulensis have a rounded dome and short rostrum. The discriminant function correctly separated 92.9\% of Loligo gahi and 88.5\% of Loligo sanpaulensis statoliths in additional samples.

  abstract = {1. Stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon are widely used in the evaluation and understanding of trophic interactions, and especially so in aquatic food-webs. However, differences among tissues which occur in consumers such as fish may confound resolution of these ecological relationships, and greatly affect dietary compositions calculated through mass-balance equations. 2.δ13C and δ15N were determined for homogenized whole fry (≈ 2·7 g) and particular tissues (white muscle, red muscle, liver and heart) of juveniles (≈ 20·6 g) of Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. 3. Differences in δ13C and δ15N were observed among tissues; removal of lipid resulted in these tissues becoming statistically indistinguishable but more variable in δ13C, particularly in tissues with higher lipid content. Differences in δ15N among tissues may be related to the relative composition of ‘essential’ and ‘non-essential’ amino acids. 5. Acidification, which is used to reduce variability caused by the presence of inorganic carbonate, had a significant effect on δ15N, while having a non-significant effect on the δ13C. This was the case for whole ground fish-fry, which contained 22·6\% inorganic carbonates in the form of bones and scales, and for individual fish tissues which contained only very small amounts of inorganic carbonate. 6. White muscle was found to be less variable in δ13C and δ15N than all other tissues, and is probably the best tissue for use in ecological work. Red muscle, which is often closely associated with white muscle, is more variable in δ13C and may constitute a source of significant error in source material identification and dietary overlap.},

The intensive exploitation of fish communities often leads to substantial reductions in the abundance of target species, with ramifications for the structure and stability of the ecosystem as a whole. 2. We explored changes in the mean trophic level of the Celtic Sea (ICES divisions VII f-j) fish community using commercial landings, survey data and estimates of trophic level derived from the analysis of nitrogen stable isotopes. 3. Our analyses showed that there has been a significant decline in the mean trophic level of survey catches from 1982 to 2000 and a decline in the trophic level of landings from 1946 to 1998. 4. The decline in mean trophic level through time resulted from a reduction in the abundance of large piscivorous fishes and an increase in smaller pelagic species which feed at a lower trophic level. 5. Similar patterns of decline in the trophic level of both catches and landings imply that there have been substantial changes in the underlying structure of the Celtic Sea fish community and not simply a change in fishery preferences. 6. We suggest that the reported changes in trophic structure result from reductions in the spawning stock biomass of traditional target species associated with intensive fishing, together with long-term climate variability. 7. The relative distribution of fish market prices has changed significantly over the past 22 years, with high trophic level species experiencing greater price rises than lower trophic level species. 8. Although decreased abundance of high trophic level species will ultimately have negative economic consequences, the reduction in mean trophic level of the fish community as a whole may allow the system to sustain higher fishery yields. 9. Management objectives in this fishery will depend on the relative values that society attaches to economic profit and protein production.}

Artisanal and recreational fishing were permitted in the Gulf. To assess the effect of the ban on the abundance of demersal resources, CPUE from experimental trawl surveys carried out before the ban (spring 1987 and 1989) and 4 years after it was in place (spring 1994) were compared. Sampling design was based on three depth strata (10–50, 51–100, 101–200m); 21 and 30 hauls were made before and after the ban, respectively. Eleven target species (9 finfish and 2 cephalopods) as well as the total catch were used for comparisons. The total catch underwent an 8-fold increase in biomass after the four-year ban, and all the considered species underwent an increase, ranging from 1.2-fold for musky octopus (Eledone moschata) to 497-fold for gurnard (Lepidotrigla cavillone). The only decrease was for horned octopus (Eledone cirrhosa). A management strategy based on year-round trawling bans may prove useful, especially in areas where multispecies and multigear artisanal fisheries make up a large part of the fishing industry. The promising results obtained in the Gulf indicate an approach which might be practicable in areas where pre-existing data useful for traditional assessment and management are poor, or totally lacking, and where resources are already at risk of overexploitation.},

Predators are often larger than their prey in food chains, but empirical evidence for positive body mass–trophic level scaling for entire food webs mostly comes from marine communities on the basis of unicellular producers. Using published data on stable isotope compositions of 1,093 consumer species, we explored how trophic level scales with body size, food web type (green vs. brown), and phylogenetic group across biomes. In contrast to widespread assumptions, the relationship between body size and trophic level of consumers—from protists to large vertebrates—was not significant per se but varied among ecosystem types and animal groups. The correlation between body size and trophic level was strong in marine consumers, weak in freshwater consumers, and absent in terrestrial consumers, which was also observed at the scale of local food webs. Vertebrates occupied higher trophic positions than invertebrates, and green trophic chains were longer than brown ones in aquatic (primarily marine) but not in terrestrial food webs. Variations in body size of top predators suggest that terrestrial and many freshwater food webs are size compartmentalized, implying different trophic dynamics and responses to perturbations than in size-structured marine food webs.},

To analyse local scale impacts of bottom trawling on food web structure we combined biological (species abundance and diets obtained from scientific bottom trawl surveys) and anthropogenic pressure (fishing effort obtained from Vessel Monitoring Systems, VMS) data. Using generalised additive models we explored the effect of bottom-trawling in nine community and trophic indicators across a gradient of fishing effort. We found an extensive effect of fishing on community indicators: with increasing fishing pressure, the biomass of seven out of fifteen functional groups declined, as well as that of the whole benthic-demersal community. Species richness was also significantly affected by bottom trawling, both at community and trophic level. We also showed a negative relationship between fishing effort and mean Trophic Level (mTL) of benthic and demersal communities at small-scale spatial resolution. Despite the apparent reduction of fishing effort observed in the study area in the last decade, we found a strong local influence of this anthropogenic pressure on the benthic-demersal food webs, demonstrating that small spatial resolution is crucial when investigating the effects of spatially heterogeneous pressures, such as fishing. Thus, we highlight the importance of analysing the effect of fishing on ecological indicators and trophic structure at local scales.},

  abstract = {Summary 1.?Invaded ecosystems present complex management issues. This problem is exacerbated in many situations by a lack of knowledge about the ecosystem. However, delaying conservation action to collect further data and so reduce such uncertainty is often either impractical or inadvisable. 2.?The Macquarie Island Pest Eradication Project, currently underway, is attempting to eradicate rabbits, rats, and mice from the island. We undertook qualitative modelling of this project, examining a range of likely outcomes and their possible ecological consequences. The results were aggregated across a large number of possible models, in order to account for uncertainty concerning interactions within the ecosystem. 3.?The results strongly support the current actions of simultaneous eradication of all three pest species, as simulated eradications of only one or two generally led to continued impacts on the island?s native biota. The results also provided support for the anticipated positive outcomes of the project, with predicted recoveries of tall tussock vegetation, and burrow- and surface-nesting seabirds. 4.?However, the model predictions also highlighted potential risks: the eradication of mice from the island may not succeed, due in part to the structural position of this species within the ecosystem. Successful eradication of all three target species could potentially release the self-introduced, non-native redpolls and starlings, allowing expansion of their populations, with possible impacts on macro-invertebrates and vegetation. 5.?Synthesis and applications. These results demonstrate that qualitative modelling approaches can in some cases deliver consistent results, despite high levels of uncertainty regarding interactions within the underlying ecosystem. Such outcomes can provide assistance in the development of strategic contingency plans and ongoing future management action.},

Persecution, catches, and tossing behavior were performed by the two females or immature males in the inlet. Next day, carcasses of several sharks were found on the beach adjacent to the attack area. Seven of them were intact and sized approximately 2.5 m in length. The presence of complete sevengill shark carcasses on the beach suggests that they were attempting to avoid capture by the killer whales by stranding on the beach. Attacks on sevengills by killer whales in Caleta Malaspina are frequent in some years, especially from midDecember to mid-January when the sevengill seems to use the inlet as a nursery ground. The observation of the same male feeding both on pinnipeds in Peninsula Valdes and on sharks in Caleta Malaspina may indicate that at least some groups in the Southwestern Atlantic could regularly feed on both fish and marine mammals. This is the first report of an attack of killer whales on sharks off the coast of Patagonia, and the first report of tossing behavior in sharks.},

  abstract = {The relationship between fish functional diversity and fishing levels at which its baselines shift is important to identify the consequences of fishing in ecosystem functioning. For the first time, the authors of this study implemented a trait-based approach in the Argentine Patagonian Sea to identify the vulnerability and spatiotemporal changes in functional diversity of fish assemblages incidentally captured by a trawling fleet targeting the Argentine red shrimp Pleoticus muelleri (Spence Bate, 1888) between 2003 and 2014. The authors coupled seven fish trophic traits to a reconstructed fish assemblage for the study area and by-catch and evaluated changes in fish species richness and four complementary functional diversity measures (functional richness, redundancy, dispersion and community trait values) along with fishing intensity, temporal use, latitudinal location and depth of fishing grounds, and vessel length. Resident fishes larger than 30 cm in length, with depressed and fusiform bodies, intermediate to high trophic levels, and feeding in benthic, demersal and midwater areas were vulnerable to by-catch. In addition, fish assemblages exhibited a low functional trait redundancy, likely related to species influxes in a biogeographic ecotone with tropicalisation signs. Significant increases in fish trait richness and dispersion poleward and deep suggested new functional roles in these grounds, matching trends in community body size, reproductive load, maximum depth and trophic level. Finally, a temporal increase in fish species and functional trait removal in fishing grounds led to trait homogenisation since 2003. The authors identified that tipping points in temperate fish functional trait diversity showed the importance of trait-based approaches within ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

Their opinions reflected a widespread belief that the seas were an inexhaustible source of food and wealth of which people could barely use a fraction. Such views were given weight by the abundant fisheries of the time. Additionally, the incredible fecundity and wide distributions of marine fishes, combined with limited exploitation, provided ample justification for optimism. The ideas of Huxley and Lamarck persist to this day, despite a sea change in the scale and depth of our influence on the oceans. Marine species could be at a far greater risk of extinction than we have assumed.},

  abstract = {Fishing impacts on marine food webs are predicted by simulations of a size spectrum community model. In this model, predation is determined by predator and prey size and abundance, and drives predator growth and prey mortality. Fishing amplifies temporal oscillations in the biomass flow. Oscillations appear at lower fishing intensity and have wider amplitude when fishing is selective (removes a narrow size range) and/or when large fish are targeted, than when fishing is more balanced (catching a larger size range) or when small fish are targeted. A novel index of size diversity is developed, and is shown to be sensitive to both fishing intensity and selectivity. To avoid unstable food web dynamics with potential harmful consequences for fisheries, limiting both fishing intensity and selectivity might be an appropriate exploitation strategy.}

D. gahi preyed on 12 different items, I. argentinus on 20 and O. ingens on 29. Prey diversity increased with the sizes of the squids. Along growth, D. gahi shifted from crustaceans, mainly euphausiids to fish (Salilota australis) and squid (D. gahi and Histioteuthis sp.). Small to mid-sized I. argentinus and O. ingens consumed mostly two fish, two squid species D. gahi and Histioteuthis atlantica, two crustaceans Munida gregaria and Munida subrugosa and the Chaetognatha Sagitta elegans. All the three species show a high prey overlapping at similar sizes: Squid of smaller size (5–15cm ML) fed mainly on crustaceans: D. gahi on euphausiids and squat lobsters (Munididae). Mid-sized squid fed mainly on fish, most frequently Gymnoscopelus sp. and S. australis, and larger I. argentinus and O. ingens fed mostly on squids, including cannibalism.

In a series of real food webs from native and agricultural soils, the strengths of the interactions were found to be patterned in a way that is important to ecosystem stability. The patterning consisted of the simultaneous occurrence of strong "top down" effects at lower trophic levels and strong "bottom up" effects at higher trophic levels. As the patterning resulted directly from the energetic organization of the food webs, the results show that energetics and community structure govern ecosystem stability by imposing stabilizing patterns of interaction strengths.},

  abstract = {Competition for food could be a major force driving changes in the community structure of skates (Rajidae) subjected to fishing exploitation. Under this hypothesis, small skates are released from competition with larger skates after fishing has depleted the larger species. Here, we compare the abundance patterns of two sympatric skates with similar niches but different life histories, Bathyraja albomaculata (larger and slow-reproducing) and Bathyraja macloviana (smaller and faster-reproducing), before (1971, 1978) and after (1998-2004) a 108\% increase in industrial bottom trawling on the southeastern South American shelf in order to test the prediction that B. macloviana should competitively exclude B. albomaculata after the increase in fishing mortality. In 1971 and 1978, there was no relationship between the abundance of both species, indicating that they coexisted over large scales. In 1998-2004, the relationship between the abundances of these skates was bell-shaped, indicating that both species increased in abundance at low densities until peaking, after which B. albomaculata decreased when B. macloviana became more abundant, consistent with resource competition. We tested whether food may be a potential limiting resource by comparing the diet of both species. The two species consumed mostly polychaetes, differing only in the consumption of polychaetes from the family Nephthyidae, which was much higher for B. macloviana. Bathyraja macloviana could replace B. albomaculata at high densities when food resources may become scarce. These results support the hypothesis that competition release is an important factor explaining the changes in skate communities in overexploited areas.},

  abstract = {Hydrography and spatial patterns of mesozooplankton communities in a frontal area off northern Patagonian were investigated in spring 1995 and 1998. Differential wind/tidal relative forcing appeared to drive along-shelf variations in the physical structure of the front and hence, planktonic patterns. Approaching the northern border of the system, the conspicuous presence of Oithona helgolandica, cladocerans and appendicularians, and the low fecundities of calanoid copepods suggest that a high proportion of the primary production may be channelled through microheterotrophic processes. Towards the southern area, calanoids dominated over cyclopoids, `large´ species (Drepanopus forcipatus, Calanoides cf. carinatus) were abundant, and copepod fecundities were high and steady, suggesting that there may be a more classical-like herbivorous food web. Paracalanus parvus and Ctenocalanus vanus occurred over the whole system but seemed to be key species in mixed and weakly stratified waters. Copepods peaked in stratified waters away from the front itself, while the abundance of eggs and nauplii was highest in weakly stratified waters next to the front. Apparently, the general heating occurring over the region in spring 1998 strongly affected both the physical and biological structure of the system. Unlike in 1995, a massive bloom of gelatinous zooplankton took place in 1998 and a bloom of the phagotrophic dinoflagellate Noctiluca sp. occurred in the northern area. Co-occurring copepod populations were depressed and their reproductive patterns seemed to be highly disrupted. Present observations stress the significance of variable external forcing in driving satisfactory habitat conditions for juvenile fish in the area.},

Fish recruitment seems to be influenced by environmental variability; the plankton would act as a link between both processes. While environmental variability can be explained in terms of physical forcing, recruitment variability is partly determined by the survival of early larvae. In this review, the available information on hydrography and plankton in relation to reproduction and feeding of hake and anchovy in the Patagonian spawning ground was summarized and integrated. The objective was to assess what is actually known about the environmental and planktonic features of the region that may have an effect on the recruitment of both species. In the Patagonian spawning ground, detection, in summer, of two major frontal systems of different nature, with a high planktonic production that would coincide with the spawning and nursery areas of hake and anchovy must be mentioned. Hence, it is suggested to test for the local species some well-known hypotheses about the possible physically-mediated mechanisms that may have an impact on the growth and survival of larvae and juveniles.},

Overlaping in the diet among these predators was estimate using cluster analysis. There was an interespecific diet overlap between juveniles belonging to demersal-benthic fish species, because all of them prey upon Stomatopoda and Munida. Adults from those species and hake prefered young and adult hake as preys, while Macruronus magellanicus and juvelines Merluccius hubbsi ate mainly zooplankton. In addition, there were son seasonal changes in prey species preferences, but food habits changed considerably with fish size.},

  abstract = {1. Local food webs result from a sequence of colonisations and extinctions by species from the regional pool or metaweb, i.e., the assembly process. Assembly is theorised to be a selective process: whether or not certain species or network structures can persist is partly determined by local processes including habitat filtering and dynamical constraints. Consequently, local food web structure should reflect these processes. 2. The goal of this study was to test evidence for these selective processes by comparing the structural properties of real food webs to the expected distribution given the metaweb. We were particularly interested in ecological dynamics; if the network properties commonly associated with dynamical stability are indeed the result of stability constraints, then they should deviate from expectation in the direction predicted by theory. 3. To create a null expectation, we used the novel approach of randomly assembling model webs by drawing species and interactions from the empirical metaweb. The assembly model permitted colonisation and extinction, and required a consumer species to have at least one prey, but had no habitat type nor population dynamical constraints. Three data sets were used: (1) the marine Antarctic metaweb, with 2 local food-webs; (2) the 50 lakes of the Adirondacks; and (3) the arthropod community from Florida Keys’ classic defaunation experiment. 4. Contrary to our expectations, we found that there were almost no differences between empirical webs and those resulting from the null assembly model. Few empirical food webs showed significant differences with network properties, motif representations and topological roles. Network properties associated with stability did not deviate from expectation in the direction predicted by theory. 5. Our results suggest that — for the commonly used metrics we considered — local food web structure is not strongly influenced by dynamical nor habitat restrictions. Instead, the structure is inherited from the metaweb. This suggests that the network properties typically attributed as causes or consequences of ecological stability are instead a by-product of the assembly process (i.e., spandrels), and may potentially be too coarse to detect the true signal of dynamical constraint.},

  abstract = {Peale's dolphin, Lagenorhynchus australis, is a common but little known species from southern South America. A review of the literature produced several observations of feeding behaviour, but only four reports on the examination of stomach contents of this species; all four were from the Cl\textbackslash St coast of the continent in the southern South Atlantic. The seven animals sampled had fed on Argentine shrimp (P/eoticus muelleri), small octopus, three species of squid (Loligo gahi; Ill ex argentinus), kingklip fish (Genypterus h/acodes), Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi) and southern cod (Salilota austral is). These species are common in the waters of the Patagoniun shelf. We report on further observations on dolphin feeding during regular shore-based studies along the central Strait of Magellan and un nine specimens from Tierm del Fuego, seven from the northeastern Atlantic coast and two young animals from the northeastern coast of the Beagle Channel. All nine animals probably died incidentally in shore-based nets set for Patagonian blenny (Eieginops mac/ovinus). We found at least 15 taxa represented in the stomach contents: eight species of fish, three of cephalopods, one bivalve mollusc, two crustaceans and one species of salp. The salps had been taken by the youngest dolphins, which also had milk in their stomachs. The most important prey species were bottom fish: hagfish (Myxine australis), southern cod (Salilota australis) and Patagonian grenadier (Macrumnus magetlanicus), followed by the red octopus (Enteroctopus mega!otyathus) and Patagonian squid (L. gahi.). The remaining species, among others Sprattus jitegensis and Ill ex argentinus, were marginal or perhaps items ingested by the other actual prey species. The feeding ecology ofPeale's dolphin off northeastern Ticrra del Fuego seems to be associated with demersal and bottom species captured in or near kelp beds.},

  abstract = {Two k-sample versions of an Anderson–Darling rank statistic are proposed for testing the homogeneity of samples. Their asymptotic null distributions are derived for the continuous as well as the discrete case. In the continuous case the asymptotic distributions coincide with the (k – 1)-fold convolution of the asymptotic distribution for the Anderson–Darling one-sample statistic. The quality of this large sample approximation is investigated for small samples through Monte Carlo simulation. This is done for both versions of the statistic under various degrees of data rounding and sample size imbalances. Tables for carrying out these tests are provided, and their usage in combining independent one- or k-sample Anderson–Darling tests is pointed out. The test statistics are essentially based on a doubly weighted sum of integrated squared differences between the empirical distribution functions of the individual samples and that of the pooled sample. One weighting adjusts for the possibly different sample sizes, and the other is inside the integration placing more weight on tail differences of the compared distributions. The two versions differ mainly in the definition of the empirical distribution function. These tests are consistent against all alternatives. The use of these tests is two-fold: (a) in a one-way analysis of variance to establish differences in the sampled populations without making any restrictive parametric assumptions or (b) to justify the pooling of separate samples for increased sample size and power in further analyses. Exact finite sample mean and variance formulas for one of the two statistics are derived in the continuous case. It appears that the asymptotic standardized percentiles serve well as approximate critical points of the appropriately standardized statistics for individual sample sizes as low as 5. The application of the tests is illustrated with an example. Because of the convolution nature of the asymptotic distribution, a further use of these critical points is possible in combining independent Anderson–Darling tests by simply adding their test statistics.},

Such widespread biodiversity is puzzling, because in ecological models it is exceedingly improbable for large communities to stably coexist. One aspect rarely considered in these models, however, is that coexisting species in natural communities are a selected portion of a much larger pool, which has been pruned by population dynamics. Here we compute the distribution of the number of species that can coexist when we start from a pool of species interacting randomly, and show that even in this case we can observe rich, stable communities. Interestingly, our results show that, once stability conditions are met, network structure has very little influence on the level of biodiversity attained. Our results identify the main drivers responsible for widespread coexistence in natural communities, providing a baseline for determining which structural aspects of empirical communities promote or hinder coexistence.},

In this study, we present a simple model of a linear food chain and systematically evaluate how stability—measured as invariability—changes with the addition or removal of trophic levels. We identify the presence of trophic cascades in the stability of species. Owing to top-down control by predation and bottom-up regulation by prey, we find that stability of a species is highest when it is at the top of the food chain and lowest when it is just under the top of the food chain. Thus, stability shows patterns identical to those of mean biomass with the addition or removal of trophic levels in food chains. Our results provide a baseline towards a general theory of the effect of adding or removing trophic levels on stability, which can be used to inform empirical studies.},

Scavenging on trawled seabeds can modify trophic size structure of bottom-dwelling fish. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 71: 398–405.Disturbance by towed bottom-fishing gears often kills larger sensitive benthos, leading to changes in the abundance, size, and species composition of benthic communities. Short-term availability of trawl-damaged prey, and longer-term shifts in benthic prey community composition, both have the potential to affect feeding opportunities and realized dietary preferences of bottom-feeding (benthivorous) fish. To investigate these effects of bottom-fishing activity (by otter trawls, beam trawls, and dredges) on the feeding of benthivorous fish, we compared the trophic level at body size and diets of four species in areas of the Celtic Sea subject to low, intermediate, and high fishing activity. Trophic level was estimated using nitrogen stable isotope analysis, and fishing activity was quantified with vessel monitoring system (VMS) data. For whiting (Merlangius merlangus) of all sizes, trophic level was slightly lower in areas of higher fishing activity. After accounting for the results of the diet analysis, we concluded that this reflected increased scavenging of benthic invertebrates in more intensively fished areas. For megrim (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis), the rate of increase in trophic level with size was lower with increasing fishing activity, implying that megrim may also substitute fish with lower-trophic invertebrates that can be scavenged in more intensively fished areas. For plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and lemon sole (Microstomus kitt), no significant effects of fishing activity on trophic level were detected. We conclude that differences in the intensity of fishing activity with towed bottom gears had small but variable effects of the trophic size structure of the four species, and that this primarily reflected scavenging rather than diet changes following longer-term shifts in composition of the prey community.},

The selected indicators are presented, how they are calculated is explained, and the philosophy behind the comparative approach is given. The combination of selected indicators is intended to reflect different dynamics, tracking processes that display differential responses to fishing, and is meant to provide a complementary means of assessing marine ecosystem trends and states. IndiSeas relied on inputs and insights provided by the local experts from participating ecosystems, helping to understand state and trend indicators and to disentangle the effect of other potential ecosystem drivers, such as climate variability. This project showed that the use of simple and available indicators under an ecosystem approach can achieve a real, wide-reaching evaluation of marine ecosystem status caused by fishing. This is important because the socio-economics of areas where fishing activities develop differs significantly around the globe, and in many countries, insufficient data are available for complex and exhaustive analyses.},

  abstract = {Ecological indicators are widely used to characterise ecosystem health. In the marine environment, indicators have been developed to assess the ecosystem effects of fishing to support an ecosystem approach to fisheries. However, very little work on the performance and robustness of ecological indicators has been carried out. An important aspect of robustness is that indicators should respond specifically to changes in the pressures they are designed to detect (e.g. fishing) rather than changes in other drivers (e.g. environment). We adopted a multi-model approach to compare and test the specificity of commonly used ecological indicators to capture fishing effects in the presence of environmental change and under different fishing strategies. We tested specificity in the presence of two types of environmental change: “random”, representing interannual climate variability and “directional”, representing climate change. We used phytoplankton biomass as a proxy of the environmental conditions, as this driver was comparable across all ecosystem models, then applied a signal-to-noise ratio analysis to test the specificity of indicators with random environmental change. For directional change, we used mean gradients to apportion the quantity of change in the indicators due to fishing and the environment. We found that depending on the fishing strategy and environmental change, ecological indicators could range from high to low specificity to fishing. As expected, the specificity of indicators to fishing almost always decreased as environmental variability increased. In 55–76\% of the scenarios run with directional change in phytoplankton biomass across fishing strategies and ecosystem models, indicators were significantly more responsive to changes in fishing than to changes in phytoplankton biomass. This important result makes the tested ecological indicators good candidates to support fisheries management in a changing environment. Among the indicators, the catch over biomass ratio was most often the most specific indicator to fishing, whereas mean length was most often the most sensitive to change in phytoplankton biomass. However, the responses of indicators were highly variable depending on the ecosystem and fishing strategy under consideration. We therefore recommend that indicators should be tested in the particular ecosystem before they are used for monitoring and management purposes.},

  abstract = {Predation can be a strong selective force affecting the social traits and habitat choice of prey species. Killer whales or orcas (Orcinus orca) and southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) coexist in the waters off Península Valdés, Argentina. Over the last three decades, right whales have changed their distribution along the Peninsula by abandoning the area with the highest occurrence of orcas and moving into two adjacent bays. Between 1972 and 2000, 117 orca – right whale encounters were observed. From 112 encounters, 63 (56.3\%; mean duration x =12.3 min) involved no apparent changes in the behavior of either species; in 37 encounters (33\%; x =27.6 min) obvious behavioral changes were seen; and in 12 encounters (10.7\%; x =81.1 min) actual attacks were observed. The orca / right whale ratio was maximum (1.8 orcas per right whale) in actual attacks, and minimum (1.3 orcas per right whale) in the other two categories. Most encounters (90.6\%) occurred along the Eastern Outer Coast of the Peninsula. Here, the overall number of encounters decreased with time, from 68 in 1972-1980, to 26 in 1981-1990, to 23 in 1991-2000. However, while encounters decreased along the Eastern Outer Coast they increased in other areas. Orcas may assess right whale group size and their own group size before approaching and attacking. During encounters, right whales showed behaviors (active calf protection, use of tail as a weapon, use of shallow waters, increased group size, rosette formation) that could be adaptive to decrease predation success. The aggregation of right whales on nursery grounds such as Península Valdés has been proposed to be an adaptation to reduce individual predation risk. The abandonment of the Eastern Outer Coast by right whales has lowered the number of encounters with orcas with a subsequent decrease in the attack rate over time. At present it is not possible to determine whether predation pressure caused the change in habitat use by right whales in Valdés. However, our data suggest that the ‘predation hypothesis’ could partly explain the shift of southern right whales into the bays.},

Discopyge tschudii preyed mainly on polychaetes. The consumption of polychaetes was higher in males. Also, amphipods and siphons of clams were preyed more heavily in the cold season and Munida gregaria in the warm season. Stomatopods were consumed more with increasing body size. All prey categories were independent of maturity stage. We concluded that D. tschudii is a benthic feeder.},

Although the dynamic implications of compartmentalization have been debated for at least four decades, a general answer has remained elusive. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate that compartmentalization acts to increase the persistence of multitrophic food webs. We then identify the mechanisms behind this result. Compartments in food webs act directly to buffer the propagation of extinctions throughout the community and augment the long-term persistence of its constituent species. This contribution to persistence is greater the more complex the food web, which helps to reconcile the simultaneous complexity and stability of natural communities.},

We demonstrate that the algorithm can sample uniformly the set of all possible matrix configurations requiring a computational effort orders of magnitude lower than that required by available methods, making it possible to easily randomize matrices larger than 108 cells.},

  abstract = {Human involvement in food webs has been profound, bringing about enormous and disproportionate losses of large apex predators on land and in water. The losses have modified or even eliminated concatenations of indirect interactions propagating from predators to herbivores to plants, inter alia. Food webs are a synthesis of bottom-up energy and nutrient flow from plant producers to consumers and top-down regulation of producers by consumers. The trophic cascade is the simplest top-down interaction and accounts for a great deal of what is known about food webs. In three-link cascades, predators suppress herbivores, releasing plants. In longer cascades, predators can suppress smaller mesopredators, releasing their prey animals. Hunting, fishing, and whaling have brought parallel losses of large apex predators to food webs. Without apex predators, smaller mesopredators have often become superabundant, sometimes with unprecedented suppression of their prey, extinctions, and endangerment. Flourishing mesopredators also can reverse the web regulation and suppress apex predators that have become rare owing to hunting and fishing. This can prevent fisheries recovery and lead to persistent alternative ecosystem states. Although food-web modules of large animals are increasingly well understood, the parts of webs consisting of small inconspicuous organisms, such as mutualists and parasites, and webs in obscure places, such as in the soil, are much of the challenge of future research.}

The composition of dominant species in trawl surveys from Beibu Gulf changed greatly from 1961–1962 to 2016–2017 and showed a shift from bottom species to pelagic species and from high-trophic-level species to low-trophic-level species. Catches of low-trophic-level species increased, while the dominance of high-trophic-level species declined. The mean trophic level of fish from the gulf declined from 3.90 in 1961–1962 to 3.45 in 1998–1999 at a rate of 0.13 of a trophic level per decade and then began to increase to 3.65 in 2016–2017 at a rate of 0.12 of a trophic level per decade. The fishing-in-balance index dropped to –0.96 in 1998–1999 and then slightly increased. The results indicate that fisheries resources in the Beibu Gulf have been overfished.

General lack of data and uncertainty about the level of employment in marine fisheries can lead to underestimation of fishing effort and hence over-exploited fisheries, or result in inaccurate projections of economic and societal costs and benefits. To address this gap, a database of marine fisheries employment for 144 coastal nations was compiled. Gaps in employment data that emerged were filled using a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the number of direct and indirect fisheries jobs. We focused on estimating jobs in the small-scale fishing sector. We characterized small-scale fishing as (i) primarily geared towards household consumption or sale at the local level; (ii) conducted at a low level of economic activity; (iii) minimally mechanized; (iv) conducted within inshore areas; (v) minimally managed; and/or (vi) undertaken for cultural or ceremonial purposes. In total, we estimated that 260 ± 6 million people are involved in global marine fisheries, encompassing full-time and part-time jobs in the direct and indirect sectors, with 22 ± 0.45 million of those being small-scale fishers. This is equivalent to 203 ± 34 million full-time equivalent jobs. Study results can be used to improve management decision making and highlight the need to improve monitoring and reporting of the number of people employed in marine fisheries globally.},

Since previous knowledge about larval feeding of the species in this region is fragmentary, adequate information is required for a complete assessment of its importance in the food web and its effect upon recruitment. Our primary objective was to examine the feeding strategy of M. hubbsi larvae in relation with prey availability in the nursery ground. Feeding incidence was 87\%; hake larvae consumed mainly calanoid copepodites {$<$}2mm in size, which were preferred prey upon more available items, and that may be nutritionally beneficial for larvae. Hake larvae were specialist at a population level toward such prey, with a narrow trophic niche. There was a clear trophic diel pattern in the number of prey ingested. Results indicate that the nursery area might be favorable for a successful feeding of hake larvae while they grow and develop. Data provided here are relevant not only to determine trophic interactions in the region but also to identify possible causes of recruitment success.},

  abstract = {Este trabajo analiza la circulación oceánica en los Golfos Norpatagónicos, una región del Mar Argentino que es ampliamente reconocida por la alta tasa de productividad y biodiversidad del ecosistema. El estudio está orientado  fundamentalmente a una exploración sistemática de los procesos físicos que controlan la circulación mediante el empleo de un modelo numérico tridimensional de alta resolución. El análisis físico del problema progresa mediante una sucesión de experimentos numéricos de complejidad creciente, comienza con el estudio de un modelo de densidad constante (barotrópico) forzado por mareas y vientos y  finaliza con el caso más complejo que incluye estratificación en la columna de agua generada por flujos de calor y humedad en la superficie. El resultado más importante que surge de este trabajo es que el forzante de mareas contribuye  significativamente a la circulación residual en escalas submareales, tanto en el modelo homogéneo como en el estratificado. Los resultados del modelo homogéneo muestran que la interacción no-lineal entre la onda de marea y la topografía de fondo conduce a la formación de diversos patrones robustos de circulación residual: giros de cuenca, vórtices batimétricos y cuadupolos costeros, formados por vórtices de recirculación en las bocas del GSJ y GN. Con la excepción de los meses de invierno, cuando los vientos son más intensos, la respuesta del océano barotrópico está completamente dominada por la circulación ciclónica residual inducida por la marea. Se requiere un viento de gran intensidad y dirección adecuada (p.e. desde el Norte) para romper este patrón. Los resultados del modelo estratificado también muestran la profunda influencia de la marea en modelar el ciclo anual de circulación dentro del Golfo San Matías. La circulación general está dominada por un intenso  giro ciclónico (compuesto de dos giros de recirculación) durante el verano y giros menores anticiclónicos en la costa sudoeste y al Norte de Península Valdés. El incremento de la circulación ciclónica entre Octubre y Febrero es producido por la interacción de la marea con la estratificación (generada por los flujos de calor) en la presencia de topografía variable. Como resultado de esta circulación cerrada, en verano el Golfo se halla prácticamente aislado de la plataforma externa. De Marzo a Setiembre con la erosión de la estratificación, el subgiro norte decae y gradualmente reduce su tamaño hasta ser absorbido por el subgiro sur. Simultáneamente el sector  Oeste del Golfo es ocupado por un giro anticilónico. La inclusión del forzante de viento no modifica sustancialmente la estructura e intensidad del los giros de verano pero intensifica tanto los giros anticiclónicos como ciclónicos durante el otoñoinvierno. El Golfo Nuevo responde de manera similar, pero en este caso hay un sólo giro ciclónico durante todo el año que se intensifica en verano y se reduce en extensión espacial en invierno con la aparición de un débil giro anticiclónico en la costa oeste. Las corrientes residuales en el Golfo San José están dominadas por un intenso dipolo durante todo el año. Aunque fue inicializado con densidad constante  en la horizontal, el modelo es además capaz de capturar la estructura e intensidad observada de los principales frentes térmicos en la plataforma externa y dentro del Golfo San Matías.},

  abstract = {Coastal temperate rocky reefs are economically valuable and highly diverse, yet the trophodynamics of these productive systems are understudied. Quantifying the trophic linkages that support fish assemblages on these reefs is valuable for understanding how these assemblages may change due to changes in benthic and pelagic primary production. The goal of this study was to quantify the relative importance of primary sources of nutrition (here, macroalgae, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus) for supporting fish assemblages on shallow rocky reefs. We constructed a general food web that traces the food sources supporting fish biomass on shallow temperate reefs near Sydney, Australia, using species composition data from 17 reefs based on field sampling and the Reef Life Survey (reeflifesurvey.com), and combined this with dietary information sourced from field collections and published literature. Planktivorous fish typically dominated reef fish assemblages, comprising an average of 41\% of the total fish biomass (ranging from 12 to 71\% among sites). Our food web analysis showed that, on average, 56\% (±5\% s.e.) of the total fish biomass was ultimately supported by phytoplankton (and 53\% from zooplankton), in comparison to 31\% (±4\%) supported by macroalgae and 12\% (±2\%) by detritus. This result highlights the dominance of zooplanktivorous fish on temperate reefs and also their importance as prey for piscivores. Our findings demonstrate the importance of understanding the coastal dynamics of plankton and planktivory for predicting the response of temperate reefs and their fish assemblages to a changing climate.},

  abstract = {Overexploitation of marine communities can lead to modifications in the structure of the food web and can force organisms like elasmobranchs to change their feeding habits. To evaluate the impact that fisheries have on food webs and on the interactions between species, it is necessary to describe and quantify the diet of the species involved and follow it through time. This study compares the diet of five skate species using the data obtained from the by-catch of the Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi) fishery in north and central Patagonia, Argentina. Diet composition was assessed by analysing the digestive tract contents and trophic overlapping between species of the genus Bathyraja: Bathyraja albomaculata, Bathyraja brachyurops, Bathyraja macloviana, Bathyraja magellanica and Bathyraja multispinis. A total of 184 stomachs were analysed. The diets of B. albomaculata and B. macloviana mainly comprised annelids, whereas that of B. brachyurops primarily comprised fish, including hake heads discarded by the fishery. The diets of B. magellanica and B. multispinis were largely based on crustaceans. Despite the morphological similarities and their shared preference for benthic habitats, no complete diet overlaps were found between the different species. These results suggest that these skate species have undergone a process of diet specialisation. This is a common feeding strategy that occurs to successfully eliminate competition when resources are limited, which corresponds to the conditions found in an environment being affected by the pressures of overfishing.},

  abstract = {South American fur seals (Arctophoca australis) inhabiting the Río de la Plata plume and adjoining areas are known to forage upon a wide range of prey (i.e. pelagic, demersal and benthic species).Since the 1960s, trawlers have operated in the area, targeting primarily demersal and benthic species. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios from 54 adult male fur seals dead stranded along the coast of southern Brazil from 1994 to 2011 were analysed to investigate whether the intensification of fishing in Río de la Plata and adjoining areas since the mid-1990s has reduced the availability of benthic and demersal prey to the growing population of South American fur seals.No significant correlation between δ13C or δ15N values and stranding year was found, thus revealing that fur seals maintained a steady diet over 17 years.Reconstruction of the isotopic landscape of the study area using potential prey of fur seals showed a spatial segregation, with prey from southern Brazil typically enriched in 13C and depleted in 15N compared with those from northern Argentina. Most adult male fur seals relied mainly on small pelagic fishes and squid captured on the continental shelf, whereas medium pelagic and demersal–benthic prey played a minor role in the diet.It is concluded that South American fur seals rely on pelagic resources (i.e. small pelagic fish and squid) more strongly than previously thought and that their diet does not reflect the varying abundance of demersal–benthic resources in the area.As long as small pelagic fish remain under-exploited in the area, competition between fisheries and fur seals is not expected. However, it is difficult to foresee how changes in the structure and dynamics of the ecosystem caused by fisheries may affect South American fur seal conservation in the long term.

  abstract = {How the complexity of food webs relates to stability has been a subject of many studies. Often, unweighted connectance is used to express complexity. Unweighted connectance is measured as the proportion of realized links in the network. Weighted connectance, on the other hand, takes link weights (fluxes or feeding rates) into account and captures the shape of the flux distribution. Here, we used weighted connectance to revisit the relation between complexity and stability. We used 15 real soil food webs and determined the feeding rates and the interaction strength matrices. We calculated both versions of connectance, and related these structural properties to food web stability. We also determined the skewness of both flux and interaction strength distributions with the Gini coefficient. We found no relation between unweighted connectance and food web stability, but weighted connectance was positively correlated with stability. This finding challenges the notion that complexity may constrain stability, and supports the ‘complexity begets stability’ notion. The positive correlation between weighted connectance and stability implies that the more evenly flux rates were distributed over links, the more stable the webs were. This was confirmed by the Gini coefficients of both fluxes and interaction strengths. However, the most even distributions of this dataset still were strongly skewed towards small fluxes or weak interaction strengths. Thus, incorporating these distribution with many weak links via weighted instead of unweighted food web measures can shed new light on classical theories.},

  abstract = {Abstract In the domain of decision-support tools for the management of marine fish resources, considerable attention has been paid to the development of models explaining how fish stocks change over space and time. In most models, fishing effort is assumed to be exogenous and determined by factors such as management. Increasingly, there has been a call for bio-economic models to also account for the dynamics of fishing fleets, recognizing that fishers respond to changing environmental, institutional and economic conditions. A growing literature has sought to explicitly model the endogenous determinants of the capacity of fishing fleets, the intensity of its use and its temporal and spatial allocation across fishing opportunities. We review this literature, focusing on empirical applications of the behavioural models that have been put forward to explain and predict observed fleet dynamics. We find that although economic factors are usually included as a dominant driver in most studies, this is often based on the use of proxy variables for the key economic drivers, for which adequate data are lacking. Also, while many studies acknowledge that social and social?psychological factors play a significant role in explaining observed fishing behaviour, their inclusion in fishing fleet dynamic models is still very limited. Progress in this domain can only be achieved via the development of multidisciplinary research programmes focusing on applied quantitative analysis of the drivers of fishing fleet dynamics.},

  abstract = {1. We examined the effects of multiple predators from an intertidal boulder food web to test whether and how three different predator species affected the survival of a small amphipod species. 2. Predators were chosen because they differ in their foraging mode, two feeding at the bottom and in benthic refuges (nemertean and shrimp) and one in the water-column (juveniles of a fish). 3. Mortality of amphipods was not affected by nemerteans, but was high in the presence of shrimp or fish. Highest mortalities were observed in predator-combinations that contained both shrimp and fish. Amphipods responded to shrimp by escaping into the water column, while they avoided fish by remaining in the refuge. We conclude that predator-specific defence causes conflicts for prey when both shrimp and fish are present. 4. Comparing observed effects of multiple predators with expected effects revealed risk enhancement for the shrimp + fish combination. A comparison of different predictive models revealed that the multiplicative model was most appropriate, although additive models may work well under certain conditions. 5. Based on known consumption-ranges of the predators used, we conclude that nemerteans were saturated with prey while fish were far from their saturation point. A predator's functional response curve (prey consumption in relation to prey abundance) determines its impact on prey populations. This knowledge appears essential in order to predict whether prey organisms face risk enhancement, risk reduction or additive effects of multiple predators.}

Their generic structure was established on the basis of literature review and analyzed by qualitative structural network analysis. Two main issues were addressed: (1) the role of species capable of forming harmful algal blooms (HABs) and red tides (Noctiluca spp.), as well as the role of jellyfish, in eutrophicated systems; (2) the contribution of human influences on food webs, focusing on bottom-up (increased nutrient loading) and top-down (overfishing) effects. Results suggest that HAB-forming species and Noctiluca stimulate the microbial network, but reduce higher trophic levels such as commercially important fish species. Jellyfish act as a buffer in eutrophicated and overfished systems, as they retain nutrients from the water column, but their blooms lead to a massive accumulation of large phytoplankton organisms. Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment favors undesirable species because of their specific position in the food web, and this crucial position may explain their far-reaching effects. Finally, while it appears that overfishing of piscivorous fishes inhibited HABs and supported blooms of diatoms and other large algae in the past, the present-day loss of planktivorous fishes acts synergistically with nutrient enrichment in promoting HAB species, Noctiluca and jellyfish. These fundamental constraints, which are inherent in the generic structure of pelagic food webs, thus largely determine community dynamics in marine coastal ecosystems.},

The paper also explores the possibility of extracting meaningful biological information from fi sheries landings by applying a Bayesian approach to two selected fi sheries. The contribution of data-poor fi sheries to the world landings from marine capture fi sheries is relatively low, but increasing (from 20 to 30\% of world landings in the last 50 years). However, data limitation can be a substantial problem at the regional and country level, especially in areas with high species diversity, small stock sizes, and where fi sheries play an important role for food security. Preliminary modeling results indicate that catch data, when combined with prior information about the dynamics of similar species/stocks and fi sheries, could be useful for informing fi sheries management in data-limited situations.},

Early mechanism-based theory asserted that food webs have little omnivory and several properties that are independent of species richness1,2,3,4,6. This theory was overturned by empirical studies that found food webs to be much more complex5,7,8,9,14,15,16,17,18, but these studies did not provide mechanistic explanations for the complexity9. Here we show that a remarkably simple model fills this scientific void by successfully predicting key structural properties of the most complex and comprehensive food webs in the primary literature. These properties include the fractions of species at top, intermediate and basal trophic levels, the means and variabilities of generality, vulnerability and food-chain length, and the degrees of cannibalism, omnivory, looping and trophic similarity. Using only two empirical parameters, species number and connectance, our ‘niche model’ extends the existing ‘cascade model’3,19 and improves its fit ten-fold by constraining species to consume a contiguous sequence of prey in a one-dimensional trophic niche20.},

We explored how variation in diet correlates with habitat type, and how these factors influence key morphological structures (mouth gape, eye diameter, fin length, fin area, and pectoral fin ratio) in a common microcarnivorous cryptic reef fish species, the triplefin Helcogrammoides cunninghami. In a mensurative experiment carried out at six kelp-dominated sites, we observed considerable differences in diet along 400 km of the Chilean coast coincident with variation in habitat availability and prey distributions. Triplefins preferred a single prey type (bivalves or barnacles) at northern sites, coincident with a low diversity of foraging habitats. In contrast, southern sites presented varied and heterogeneous habitats, where triplefin diets were more diverse and included amphipods, decapods, and cumaceans. Allometry-corrected results indicated that some morphological structures were consistently correlated with different prey items. Specifically, large mouth gape was associated with the capture of highly mobile prey such as decapods, while small mouth gape was more associated with cumaceans and copepods. In contrast, triplefins that capture sessile prey such as hydroids tend to have larger eyes. Therefore, morphological structures co-vary with habitat selection and prey usage in this species. Our study shows how an abundant generalist reef fish exhibits variable feeding morphologies in response to the distribution of potential habitats and prey throughout its range.},

A qualitative and quantitative analysis was made. The trophic spectrum was analysed by fish size class, season and bathymetric depth. A trend to euryphagy and trophic opportunism was evident. Castaiieta preyed primarily on polychaetes and secondarily on crustaceans. This species showed both seasonal and bathymetric variations in its trophic spectrum. The diet of juveniles was closely related to the pelagic food web (copepods and euphausids), whereas adults consumed benthic organisms (polychaetes, echinoderms and gammarid amphipods). Such a trend was more evident among larger fish.},

  abstract = {An assessment survey on the austral fish was carried out during the summer 1997 on both the shelf and slope off southern Argentina. The cruise covered 101,508 nm2 between 45° and 54° 30'S and depths between 50 and 400 m. The survey did not include the area controlled by the United Kingdom. Considering the total area as an undivided stratum, a random sampling was used to estimate demersal fish biomass and a delta distribution-based model to evaluate mean densities. Out of the forty five species caught 28 were bony fish and 17 elasmobranch. Four cephalopod mollusc species were also identified. A biomass of 3.2 million tons (CI(95o/o): 1.90 - 6.06 millions) proved that longtail hake was the most abundant resource within the region followed by common hake (590,000 tons), patagonian cod and notothenids (slightly over 200,000 tons each). Pink cuskeel reached almost 190,000 tons. Among other fish species, only Psammobatis spp: rayswere over 100,000 tons. The main longtail hake concentrations (100 t/nm2) were found between 48° and 52° 30´S at water depths between 50 - 100 m. Size distribution of longtail hake ranged 18 - 110 cm TL with a mode at 54 cm. Fitting of length(cm) - weight (g) relationship parameters resulted in W = 0.0099 * TL 2.7215.  Length at 50 percent first maturity (TL(50o/o)) was estimated at 59.4 cm. Distribution patterns, maximum densities, size structures, length - weight relationship and length at 50 percent maturity related to the other above mentioned species are also reported. From 2,669 otolith readings, length growthparameters corresponding to longtail hake were estimated as follows: L?= 88.15 cm TL; K = 0.245 year-1 and t0 = -0.425 years (males) and L? = 100.92 cm TL; K = 0.190 year-1 and t0 = -0.610 years (females). Significant differences between sexes were observed. Age group 3 (year class 1993) was the most abundant (2,600 millions of individuals). Natural mortality (M) estimates for the species ranged 0.22 - 0.269 whereas total mortality (Z) between ages 4 and 11 was estimated to be 0.335. Studies on fish feeding showed that longtail hake, southern blue whiting and common hake ate mainly zooplankton species such as amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii and euphausiid Euphausia lucens as well as small fish(notothenids, longtail hake juveniles, anchovies, sprats). Other predators, including pink cuskeel, southern hake, patagonian cod, spiny dogfish and Raja flavirostris fed mainly on macrocrustaceans, cephalopods (squid and octopus) and fish(notothenids and longtail hake). Cannibalism, representing 65 percent of the total longtail hake ingested, would be exerted only on young-of-the-year fish whereas predation would be suffered by 0 to 3 year old fish. Nematod Anisakis sp. was responsible for the high degree of parasitism found in southern blue whiting. Different parasites were identified in gills, mesentery,liver, stomach, pyloric caeca and gut.Sea surface temperature ranged 7.5 - 12.5°C. A thermic front (0.02°C/km) was found between 50° and 51°S. Bottom temperature decreased as waters became deeper. Encounter on the shelf of low salinitycoastal waters ( 33.2 psu) and outer waters from the Malvinas current (33.8 to 34.2 psu) generated saline fronts mostly between 53° and 54°S. A strong thermocline was found between 47° and 51°S. It registered a maximum gradient of 5°C/mat 50 m deep waters in the central shelf region. Haloclines were found south of 51°S at depths between 50-70 m. Sea water density within the northern region was mainly influenced by temperature values whereas salinity was the key factor southwards. Zooplankton densities ranged 18.5 - 2488.8 mg/m3. The largest biomasses were found in coastal waters within the area of Bahía Grande (50°-52°S) where T. gaudichaudii was the most abundant species. Differences between day and night zooplankton distribution produced important echo traces only during dark hours.},

  abstract = {Omnivory, feeding at more than one trophic level, is a prevalent feature of freshwater ecosystems. Understanding where and when omnivory is important, its relevance for sustaining diversity, and the effect it may have on ecosystem responses to disturbances, are necessary for effective management of freshwater ecosystems. The many theoretical predictions of the effects of omnivory are often contradictory, and empirical studies aimed at understanding omnivory have been difficult and contingent on a number of factors. Here, I synthesise theoretical evidence to generate five predictions of where omnivory will be most important in freshwater ecosystems, how it is maintained and the effect it will have on communities. First, theory indicates that, while strong omnivorous interactions are destabilising, weak omnivorous interactions usually enhance stability. Therefore, mechanisms which decrease the strength of omnivorous interactions should favour their occurrence and increase stability of food webs. Secondly, omnivorous interactions which are theoretically unstable may be found in stable food webs due to stabilising features of the web as a whole. Thirdly, omnivory is likely to persist primarily at intermediate productivity levels and be more common in disturbed environments. Fourthly, omnivory is likely to decrease the strength of trophic cascades. Finally, omnivores should generally make more successful invaders. These predictions are important for effective freshwater management because actions which decrease the strength of omnivorous interactions, such as maintaining habitat refuges for consumers (e.g. woody debris and aquatic plants), may be essential for sustaining biodiversity. In addition, if omnivores make better invaders, effective invasion management may benefit from focussing resources on omnivorous invaders to limit their spread and impact. Overall, this synthesis of theoretical and empirical studies indicates that, while their predictions may be frequently at odds, with deeper investigation they are largely reconcilable and can be used to make practical suggestions for the careful management of omnivory in freshwater food webs.},

  abstract = {Random environmental variation, or stochasticity, is a key determinant of ecological dynamics. While we have some appreciation of how environmental stochasticity can moderate the variability and persistence of communities, we know little about its implications for the nature and predictability of ecological responses to large perturbations. Here, we show that shifts in the temporal autocorrelation (colour) of environmental noise provoke trade-offs in ecological stability across a wide range of different food-web structures by stabilizing dynamics in some dimensions, while simultaneously destabilizing them in others. Specifically, increasingly positive autocorrelation (reddening) of environmental noise increases resilience by hastening the recovery of food webs following a large perturbation, but reduces their resistance to perturbation and increases their temporal variability (reduces biomass stability). In contrast, all stability dimensions become less predictable, showing increased variability around the mean response, as environmental noise reddens. Moreover, we found environmental reddening to be a considerably more important determinant of stability than intrinsic food-web characteristics. These findings reveal the fundamental and dominant role played by environmental stochasticity in determining the dynamics and stability of ecosystems, and extend our understanding of how the multiple dimensions of stability relate to each other beyond simple white noise environments.},

The paper discusses how an EAF can be adopted for data limited fisheries and uses the northern South China Sea fishery as an example to demonstrate the selection and use of indicators for determining the states of the fishery and its relevant ecosystem to provide advice on management. Implementing EAF management requires indicators and models that address the impact of fishing across entire ecological communities and determine management actions to be taken to achieve the preset objectives according to decision rules. Data limited fisheries necessarily have limited resources for data collection and scientific studies and therefore could not support complex models. To overcome the data limitation and absence of modelling support, simple indicators have to be used to assess the current state and monitor changes of the fishery and its ecosystem. Such indicators should: (1) be observable and understandable by all stakeholders, (2) be based on easily obtainable and reliable data, (3) adequately reflect the condition of the resource, and (4) have associated reference values and responsive management measures. The paper also reviews the recent development and use of indicators and harvest strategies in both conventional and EAF management to better understand the differences and to shed light on the challenges of EAF, in particular for data limited fisheries.},

However, there is very little evidence that this is a realistic viewpoint. To test this fundamental assumption ‘empirically’, I have constructed here plausible community matrices1,2 corresponding to 40 real food webs3 and studied their local stability properties. I find that stability (in the sense of tending to return to the presumed equilibrium after a small perturbation) is far more likely if the interaction strengths are chosen in accord with the nature of the particular organisms in each food web, rather than strictly at random. Either this is a monumental coincidence, or the equilibrium viewpoint really is appropriate for quite a few real communities. Additional results of this analysis are that stability generally requires a degree of intraspecific interference on the part of some consumer species, whereas interspecific interference tends to exert a destabilizing influence.},

  abstract = {As in many regions worldwide, seabird colonies in Argentina are important conservation targets of marine protected areas (MPAs). Seabirds are wide ranging, often crossing jurisdictional boundaries during foraging. Using a recently designated MPA as a case study, this article discusses the challenges of protecting breeding seabirds given their spatial requirements and use of different jurisdictions. Seabirds breeding at the MPA have distinct foraging strategies. Rock Shags and Olrog's Gulls forage inshore within the MPA. Imperial Cormorants, Magellanic Penguins, and Southern Giant Petrels, in contrast, often feed beyond the MPA's jurisdiction, traveling into provincial, federal, or international waters where they can be affected by fisheries and oil development. This indicates the need of management actions beyond MPA boundaries. The large scale and connectivity of marine ecosystems and the variety of economic pressures require the participation of stakeholders and several government agencies in conservation issues, and thus integrated coastal management and marine spatial planning appear as options to complement the use of MPAs. Although MPAs are a valuable tool to conserve breeding seabirds, increased efforts are needed to design new governance structures and complementary strategies for spatial protection so as to deal with the biological, social, and political complexities of marine systems.},

A total of 112 adults were flushed during the early and late chick stages of 2011 and 2012 at Isla Vernacci Norte, and at least 15 prey taxa were found, including fishes, cephalopods, crustaceans and polychaetes. Overall, Argentine anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) showed the highest contribution in terms of importance by mass (68.1–85.3\%, depending on chick stage and year), except for the old chick stage in 2011 when the shortfin squid (Illex argentinus) was the main prey consumed (56.0\%). Based on carbon and nitrogen isotopic values from a total of 256 blood samples, corresponding to young and old chicks and to adults of both sexes sampled throughout the incubation, chick and moult stages at the above mentioned colony and years, Bayesian mixing model outputs showed that Argentine anchovy was always the main prey (48–86\%). Bayesian mixing model outputs obtained from adults of both sexes and their chicks during the late chick stage of 2013 at Isla Vernacci Norte, Isla Tova and Isla Leones also showed that Argentine anchovy was the main prey consumed. This is the first comprehensive assessment of Magellanic penguin diet composition in northern Patagonia, quantifying the relative contribution of prey in the diet of adults and chicks at different stages of the annual cycle and years, and confirms the relevance of a forage fish such as the Argentine anchovy in its trophic ecology.},

  abstract = {Monitoring programmes are essential for detecting population changes, but data series are difficult to sustain over time. Additionally, wide-scale monitoring is needed to adequately interpret demographic behaviour given the metapopulation dynamics characteristics of most seabird species and to understand the underlying factors, such as anthropogenic pressures and climate change. Many cormorant species are largely dependent on coastal marine environments, which are subject to increasing pressures from human activities. Here, we update information on the distribution and size of Imperial Cormorant (Leucocarbo atriceps) colonies along 1,000 km of coastline in Argentina, and review published information to assess population trends at different spatial scales over 26 years (1990–2016). During 2016, the number of nests per colony ranged between 2 and 5,617 (median: 441 nests; n = 26). Total number of breeding pairs was estimated at 21,482. During the study period, two new locations were colonised, whilst another two were abandoned. Significant growth rates ranged from 1.022 to 1.117 (median: 1.036; n = 6) for increasing colonies and from 0.580 to 0.977 (median: 0.962; n = 8) for declining colonies, but the overall breeding population remained stable between 1990 and 2016 (λ = 1.000, C.I. 95\% = 0.991–1.008). Our study provides one of the longest time series on seabird breeding numbers along a wide coastal sector in South America. Given the high yearly variability in nest numbers at individual Imperial Cormorant colonies, as well as the observed establishment and extinction of colonies, large scale and long term monitoring is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of overall changes in the population distribution patterns.},

  abstract = {Food webs capture the trophic relationships and energy fluxes between species, which has fundamental impacts on ecosystem functioning and stability. Within a food web, the energy flux distribution between a predator and its prey species is shaped by food quantity–quality trade-offs and the contiguity of foraging. But the distribution of energy fluxes among prey species as well as its drivers and implications remain unclear. Here we used 157 aquatic food webs, which contain explicit energy flux information, to examine whether a predator's foraging is asymmetric and biased towards lower or higher trophic levels, and how these patterns may change with trophic level. We also evaluate how traditional topology-based approaches may over- or under-estimate a predator's trophic level and omnivory by ignoring the asymmetric foraging patterns. Our results demonstrated the prevalence of asymmetric foraging in natural aquatic food webs. Although predators prefer prey at higher trophic levels with potentially higher food quality, they obtain their energy mostly from lower trophic levels with a higher food quantity. Both tendencies, that is, stronger feeding preference for prey at higher trophic levels and stronger energetic reliance on prey at lower trophic levels are alleviated for predators at higher trophic levels. The asymmetric foraging lowers trophic levels and omnivory at both species and food web levels, compared to estimates from traditional topology-based approaches. Such overestimations by topology-based approaches are most pronounced for predators at lower trophic levels and communities with higher number of trophic species. Our study highlights the importance of energy flux information in understanding the foraging behaviour of predators as well as the structural complexity of natural food webs. The increasing availability of flux-based food web data will thus provide new opportunities to reconcile food web structure, functioning and stability.},

  abstract = {Globally, many fish species are overexploited, and many stocks have collapsed. This crisis, along with increasing concerns over flow-on effects on ecosystems, has caused a reevaluation of traditional fisheries management practices, and a new ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) paradigm has emerged. As part of this approach, selective fishing is widely encouraged in the belief that nonselective fishing has many adverse impacts. In particular, incidental bycatch is seen as wasteful and a negative feature of fishing, and methods to reduce bycatch are implemented in many fisheries. However, recent advances in fishery science and ecology suggest that a selective approach may also result in undesirable impacts both to fisheries and marine ecosystems. Selective fishing applies one or more of the “6-S” selections: species, stock, size, sex, season, and space. However, selective fishing alters biodiversity, which in turn changes ecosystem functioning and may affect fisheries production, hindering rather than helping achieve the goals of EBFM. We argue here that a “balanced exploitation” approach might alleviate many of the ecological effects of fishing by avoiding intensive removal of particular components of the ecosystem, while still supporting sustainable fisheries. This concept may require reducing exploitation rates on certain target species or groups to protect vulnerable components of the ecosystem. Benefits to society could be maintained or even increased because a greater proportion of the entire suite of harvested species is used.},
