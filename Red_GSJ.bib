  abstract = {The study of temporal patterns in diet composition is crucial to interpret adequately several aspects of seabird ecology and life history. The variation in prey composition and prey size in relation to chick age were evaluated in a South American Tern (Sterna hirundinacea) colony at Punta Loma, Argentina, during the 2006 breeding season. The diet of South American Tern chicks consisted of at least 12 prey items. Fish, mostly Argentine anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) and silverside (Odontesthes argentinensis) were the main prey delivered (91\%) to the chicks. The relative proportion of prey types varied among chick age-classes and the proportion of Argentine anchovy in the diet increased with chick age, reaching 58\% in older chicks. Larger prey items were delivered to older chicks. Prey stolen by other adult terns was significantly larger than the prey actually consumed by the chicks. South American terns at the Punta Loma colony appear to confront the increasing demand of growing chicks by increasing the quality of prey in each feeding trip, reflected in larger and more energetic prey.

  abstract = {Large, complex networks of ecological interactions with random structure tend invariably to instability. This mathematical relationship between complexity and local stability ignited a debate that has populated ecological literature for more than three decades. Here we show that, when species interact as predators and prey, systems as complex as the ones observed in nature can still be stable. Moreover, stability is highly robust to perturbations of interaction strength, and is largely a property of structure driven by predator–prey loops with the stability of these small modules cascading into that of the whole network. These results apply to empirical food webs and models that mimic the structure of natural systems as well. These findings are also robust to the inclusion of other types of ecological links, such as mutualism and interference competition, as long as consumer–resource interactions predominate. These considerations underscore the influence of food web structure on ecological dynamics and challenge the current view of interaction strength and long cycles as main drivers of stability in natural communities.},

May analysed large networks in which species interact at random. However, in natural systems pairs of species have well-defined interactions (for example predator-prey, mutualistic or competitive). Here we extend May's results to these relationships and find remarkable differences between predator-prey interactions, which are stabilizing, and mutualistic and competitive interactions, which are destabilizing. We provide analytic stability criteria for all cases. We use the criteria to prove that, counterintuitively, the probability of stability for predator-prey networks decreases when a realistic food web structure is imposed or if there is a large preponderance of weak interactions. Similarly, stability is negatively affected by nestedness in bipartite mutualistic networks. These results are found by separating the contribution of network structure and interaction strengths to stability. Stable predator-prey networks can be arbitrarily large and complex, provided that predator-prey pairs are tightly coupled. The stability criteria are widely applicable, because they hold for any system of differential equations.},

Here we show that these interaction strengths are structured nonrandomly in a large Caribbean marine food web. Specifically, the cooccurrence of strong interactions on two consecutive levels of food chains occurs less frequently than expected by chance. Even when they occur, these strongly interacting chains are accompanied by strong omnivory more often than expected by chance. By using a food web model, we show that these interaction strength combinations reduce the likelihood of trophic cascades after the overfishing of top predators. However, fishing selectively removes predators that are overrepresented in strongly interacting chains. Hence, the potential for strong community-wide effects remains a threat.},

Here, we document the species’ precipitous decline in eastern Ionian Sea coastal waters across 13 yr. While 150 animals were present in the study area (1050 km2) in 1996, only 15 were observed in 2007. A 12 mo assessment of fishing effort and catch, together with circumstantial evidence, suggests that the decline was caused largely by prey depletion resulting from overfishing. We analyzed the impacts of various fishing gear and estimated the degree of resource overlap between common dolphins and local fisheries. The total biomass removed annually by 308 fishing boats in the study area averaged 3571 t, while that consumed by common dolphins was 17 t. Resource overlap between common dolphins and fisheries — expressed as an average Pianka index of 0.5 — differed according to fishing gear, being higher for purse seiners (0.7) and beach seiners (0.4) and lower for bottom trawlers (0.1), trammel boats (0.2) and longliners (0.0). Only about 10 active purse seiners (4\% of the total active fishing fleet) were responsible for 33\% of the biomass removal, and likely had the greatest impact on prey of common dolphins. This study indicates a high risk of local disappearance of common dolphins in the very near future, unless fishery management measures are implemented immediately. Purse seining should be the main management target.},

Here, we show a pronounced latitudinal increase in phytoplanktonic and zooplanktonic biodiversity in the extratropical North Atlantic Ocean in recent decades. We also show that this rise in biodiversity paralleled a decrease in the mean size of zooplanktonic copepods and that the reorganization of the planktonic ecosystem toward dominance by smaller organisms may influence the networks in which carbon flows, with negative effects on the downward biological carbon pump and demersal Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Our study suggests that, contrary to the usual interpretation of increasing biodiversity being a positive emergent property promoting the stability/resilience of ecosystems, the parallel decrease in sizes of planktonic organisms could be viewed in the North Atlantic as reducing some of the services provided by marine ecosystems to humans.},

Stomach contents from fish captured using a bottom trawl net, and zooplankton samples collected with a Bongo net, were analyzed. Acoustic data were examined to identify pelagic aggregations and quantify relative prey abundance. The Argentine hake M. hubbsi fed mainly on crustaceans (92.7\%IRI), followed by fish (7.1\%IRI) and cephalopods (0.2\%IRI). Among crustaceans, the diet was dominated by euphausiids (Euphausia spp.), the lobster krill Munida gregaria, and the hyperiid amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii. The most consumed fish was other hake by cannibalism. Prey availability was also numerically dominated by the euphausiids (Euphausia spp.), followed by the hyperiid amphipod T. gaudichaudii and the lobster krill M. gregaria. Ontogenetic dietary changes were detected: consumption of euphausiids and amphipods decreased with predator´s total length, and the consumption of the lobster krill M. gregaria was higher in adult specimens. The Argentine hake M. hubbsi showed positive prey selection for lobster krill M. gregaria. The consumption of Euphausiids decreased with the increasing acoustic abundance of the lobster krill M. gregaria. The cannibalism was denso-independent. The Argentine hake appeared to be opportunistic when the proportion of prey eaten to the proportion present in the environment was compared, but deeper analyses confirmed that zooplankter with increased abundances and higher energy density was the preferred prey.},

  abstract = {The white-chinned petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis) is an abundant, widespread petrel breeding in tussock grassland at sub-Antarctic islands. Over the last decade it has been killed in large numbers in temperate and sub-tropical longline fisheries. However no data are available on the global population status. We assessed the status of white-chinned petrels at Bird Island, South Georgia by comparing the distribution and density of occupied burrows in 1981 and 1998. In both surveys white-chinned petrel burrows occurred in one-quarter of the 460–477 36-m2 quadrats surveyed. The total number of burrows in each quadrat was consistent between each survey but we estimate an overall decrease of 28\% in those occupied (with considerable variation between sites). Concurrent data on breeding frequency and success showed that white-chinned petrels are essentially annual breeders at Bird Island; breeding success was consistent at around 44\%. Significant factors determining densities of occupied burrows were crown height and percent tussock cover (accounting for 77\% of variance). The former has decreased significantly, the latter increased significantly between 1981 and 1998 but there was no relationship between white-chinned petrel occupancy rate and habitat modification due to the presence of fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella). This suggests that any population decline is due to factors operating away from the breeding colony, such as those attributed to fishing.},

  abstract = {A food web customarily describes the qualitative feeding relationships in a community. Descriptors have been used to extract ecologically meaningful information from such data, e.g., the proportion of top species (the proportion of taxa without consumers) or vulnerability (the average number of consumers per taxon). Analyses of collections of food webs based on these properties have revealed regularities that fostered the formulation of models of food-web structure. However, it has been shown that most of these qualitative descriptors are highly sensitive to the varying levels of sampling effort used to document a food web. The principal problem is that webs described extensively include trophic links of highly uneven magnitude, with typically few strong/important links and a wealth of weak ones; with qualitative descriptors, the same weight is given to all trophic interactions. To overcome this problem, food webs should be described and analyzed quantitatively. Consequently, we propose here a suite of food-web descriptors, which are built on information-theory indices and take the magnitude of the trophic interactions into account. We define descriptors having a similar meaning as the classical qualitative indices. Two versions of each quantitative descriptor are proposed, one giving the same weight to each taxon, and one weighting each taxon by the total amount of its incoming and outgoing biomass flows. We use a published quantitative food web to exemplify the computation of the new descriptors, and discuss their potential and limitations.},

  abstract = {There is a widely acknowledged need to explicitly include humans in our conceptual and mathematical models of food webs. However, a simple and generalized method for incorporating humans into fisheries food webs has yet to be established. We developed a simple graphical framework for defining whole-system inland fishery food webs that includes a continuum of fishery behaviors. This range of behaviors mimics those of generalist to specialist predators, which differentially influence ecosystem diversity, sustainability, and functioning. Fishery behaviors in this food-web context are predicted to produce a range of “fishery types” – from targeted (ie specialist) to multispecies (ie generalist) inland fisheries – and relate to the socioeconomic status of fishery participants. Fishery participants in countries with low Human Development Index (HDI) values are highly connected through fisheries food webs relative to humans in more developed countries. Our framework shows that fisheries can occupy a variety of roles within a food-web model and may thereby affect food-web stability in different ways. This realization could help to improve sustainable fisheries management at a global scale.},

Significant differences in the species prey items were found between sampling sites; however, sedentary polychaetes were the main consumed group at both sites.

We offer an explanation based on the stability of food chains that have been shifted away from linearity to be more web-like. We start with a simple example of food webs of two to six species arranged so that species consume all those with a trophic level less than their own. The probability of stability, for such “universal omnivory” chains declined strongly with chain length, and was as low as 1\% with six level chains but highest for two and three level chains. We further explored the influence of chain length on food web stability by testing food webs with varying levels of connectance that were constructed either randomly or with the niche model. By additionally altering the relative impacts of predators on prey, and vice-versa, we test the role of our assumptions on the relationship between chain length and stability. Food webs characterized by low to moderate degrees of connectance, asymmetrical interactions, and relatively weak density dependence showed a pattern of reduced stability with longer trophic chains. The simple view that food webs characterized by long trophic chains are less stable seems to resolve the long-standing question of why there are so few trophic levels in nature.},

Although there are thirteen possible configurations of three species subgraphs, some are consistently over-represented in empirical food webs. This is a robust pattern that is found across marine, freshwater or terrestrial environments. The preferential elimination of unstable subgraphs during the assembly of the food web can explain the observed pattern. It follows from this hypothesis that there should be differences in the stability of different subgraphs, and that stability should be positively correlated to their frequency in food webs. Using 50 food webs collected from a variety of databases I determined the frequency of each of the thirteen possible subgraphs with respect to randomized webs. Then by numerical simulation I determined the quasi sign stability (QSS) of each subgraph. My results clearly show a positive correlation between QSS and over-representation of the different subgraphs in empirical food webs.},

  abstract = {Two competing models currently offer to explain empirical regularities observed in food webs. The Lotka-Volterra model describes population dynamics; the cascade model describes trophic structure. In a real ecological community, both population dynamics and trophic structure are important. This paper proposes and analyses a new hybrid model that combines population dynamics and trophic structure: the Lotka-Volterra cascade model (LVCM). The LVCM assumes the population dynamics of the Lotka-Volterra model when the interactions between species are shaped by a refinement of the cascade model. A critical surface divides the three-dimensional parameter space of the LVCM into two regions. In one region, as the number of species becomes large, the limiting probability that the LVCM is qualitatively globally asymptotically stable is positive. In the region on the other side of the critical surface, and on the critical surface itself, this limiting probability is zero. Thus the LVCM displays an ecological phase transition: gradual changes in the probabilities of various kinds of population dynamical interactions related to feeding can have sharp effects on a community’s qualitative stability. The LVCM shows that an inverse proportionality between connectance and the number of species, and a direct proportionality between the number of links and the number of species, as observed in data on food webs, need not be directly connected with the qualitative global asymptotic stability or instability of population dynamics. Empirical testing of the LVCM will require field data on the population dynamical effects of feeding relations.},

The effects of towed bottom-fishing gear on benthic communities is the subject of heated debate, but the generality of trawl effects with respect to gear and habitat types is poorly understood. To address this deficiency we undertook a meta-analysis of 39 published fishing impact studies. 2. Our analysis shows that inter-tidal dredging and scallop dredging have the greatest initial effects on benthic biota, while trawling has less effect. Fauna in stable gravel, mud and biogenic habitats are more adversely affected than those in less consolidated coarse sediments. 3. Recovery rate appears most rapid in these less physically stable habitats, which are generally inhabited by more opportunistic species. However, defined areas that are fished in excess of three times per year (as occurs in parts of the North Sea and Georges Bank) are likely to be maintained in a permanently altered state. 4. We conclude that intuition about how fishing ought to affect benthic communities is generally supported, but that there are substantial gaps in the available data, which urgently need to be filled. In particular, data on impacts and recovery of epifaunal structure-forming benthic communities are badly needed.},

Several seabird species exploit discards from fisheries as their main food. The southern giant petrel Macronectes giganteus is a wide-ranging procellariform. It is considered a near-threatened species under International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and has been included as a threatened species in the Appendix 2 of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. The diet of Patagonian colonies of this species remains unknown, even though understanding the relationship between southern giant petrels and fisheries may be crucial to the conservation of this species in the Southwestern Atlantic. We describe the diet of the southern giant petrel from north Patagonian colonies using chick regurgitations and evaluate its relationships with the fisheries. Carrion occurred in the diets of 90.8\% of birds sampled, while cephalopods occurred in the diets of 65.1\%. Crustaceans were present in 43.7\% of samples and fishes in 19.4\%. Anthropogenic items were found in 72.7\% of the samples. The presence in the petrel diet of target and discarded species from fishery vessels, and the high incidence of marine debris, suggests an extensive use of discard over the Patagonian Shelf. The population of southern giant petrels in northern Patagonia has reached higher, stable levels. Such a population trend could be linked, at least partially, to the use of fisheries discards.},

Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is one of these methods. Here we review the foundations of ABC, its recent algorithmic developments, and its applications in evolutionary biology and ecology. We argue that the use of ABC should incorporate all aspects of Bayesian data analysis: formulation, fitting, and improvement of a model. ABC can be a powerful tool to make inferences with complex models if these principles are carefully applied.},

Bearing in mind the different characteristics of ice-chilling and freezer fleets, their activities were analyzed separately. Considering the relative percentages of catches declared in fishery statistics, the dynamics of each fleet is described per quarter and year. Special reference is made to 1997 when a closed area to protect juveniles was introduced between 44°S-47°S and 62°W-65°W. The freezer fleet activity, concentrated South of 41°S, especially South of 43°S, was stable throughout the period. It grouped around the closed area of Escondida Island during the summer 1st and 4th quarters) to disperse in deeper waters in winter 2nd and 3rd quarters. In the 2nd quarter it formed two nuclei, one to the North -and the most important- to the South of 41°S. The dynamics of the ice-chilling fleet per season was similar to that of the freezer fleetnevertheless, contrary to the latter, activities concentrated between 39°S and 42°S and, of the two  nuclei formed in the 2nd quarter, the most important was the one North of 41°S. In 1995 a marked change was observed when concentration of the fleet ranged between 39°S and 42°S and the South nucleus practically disappeared.},

  abstract = {The worldwide shrimp (Penaeid) landings has remained stable in almost 3.5 metric tons since 2012. The Argentine red shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri) fishery done in the Argentine Sea, has been the only crustacean fishery increasing their captures and its total value in recent years (FAO, 2016). Historically, landings of this species has been highly variable, with inter-annual differences of up to 30,000 metric tons, but since the 2006 fishing season annual landings have consistently increased up to a maximum of 170,000 tons in 2016 (Argentine Statistics, SSPyA, 2017). The Argentine red shrimp is the main target of part of the Argentinian freezer trawlers exclusively dedicated to catch this crustacean, in addition to coastal and deep-sea fresh trawlers that, depending on the commercially available marine resources, decide which species to catch. It life cycle is exclusively spent in marine waters, without any need to migrate to coastal lagoons and/or estuaries as other Penaeid families, thus being distinguished from most commercial subtropical and tropical shrimps. This shrimp fishery has been extensively studied by Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo Pesquero (INIDEP) since its beginnings, when large volume shoaling were detected in San Jorge Gulf at the beginning of the 1980s by the fishing fleet . INIDEP research is intended to present scientific data and management tools to avoid growth and/or recruitment overfishing of this important fishery for Argentina, with the objective to look for ecological sustainability. Studies regarding shrimp population dynamics, fishery assessment, status evaluation of benthic organisms found in the shrimp distribution areas, and continuous surveillance of the bycatch of bony and cartilaginous fish are carried out. Ecosystem approach goals are being developed with the purpose of understand and manage the ecosystem where the species thrive.Its northern and southern limit distribution are: Río de Janeiro, Brazil (23°00'S) and Santa Cruz, Argentina (50°0'S).},

  abstract = {Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems ? such as communities ? through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with ? what we believe to be ? their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.},

Here we infer the expansion of Munida gregaria populations in the Beagle Channel and the Argentine Patagonian Shelf by means of acoustic surveys of pelagic swarms. We also describe the habitat characteristics in which these swarms occur. Acoustic data was collected during three multidisciplinary scientific cruises on board of the R/V Puerto Deseado during 2009, 2012 and 2014. Despite differences in the environmental conditions between the two surveyed areas, between 2009 and 2014 pelagic swarms increased their occurrence and abundance both in the Beagle Channel and on the Argentine Patagonian Shelf. Towards the end of the studied period, pelagic swarms of M. gregaria occurred in new locations, supporting the notion of a population expansion. Within the Beagle Channel swarm expansions were more marked than on the Patagonian Shelf. We here postulate that M. gregaria expansions occur in association with productive areas of the Argentine continental shelf, such as frontal zones, favoured by the squat lobster phenotypic plasticity that permit to exploit resources in both the neritic and benthic environments. At a regional scale on the Patagonian Shelf, three main groups of pelagic swarms of M. gregaria were clearly associated to respective frontal zones. The information presented here is necessary to understand fluctuations in both distribution and abundance patterns of a key species on the Argentine continental shelf. These fluctuations could be direct or indirect indicators of changes in the ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Determining the importance of physical and biological drivers in shaping biodiversity in diverse ecosystems remains a global challenge. Advancements have been made towards this end in large marine ecosystems with several studies suggesting environmental forcing as the primary driver. However, both empirical and theoretical studies point to additional drivers of changes in diversity involving trophic interactions and, in particular, predation. Moreover, a more integrated but less common approach to the assessment of biodiversity changes involves analyses of spatial β diversity, whereas most studies to date assess only changes in species richness (α diversity). Recent research has established that when cod, a dominant generalist predator, was overfished and collapsed in a northwest Atlantic food web, spatial β diversity increased; that is, the spatial structure of the fish assemblage became increasingly heterogeneous. If cod were to recover, would this situation be reversible, given the inherent complexity and non-linear dynamics that typify such systems? A dramatic increase of cod in an ecologically similar large marine ecosystem may provide an answer. Here we show that spatial β diversity of fish assemblages in the Barents Sea decreased with increasing cod abundance, while decadal scale changes in temperature did not play a significant role. These findings indicate a reversibility of the fish assemblage structure in response to changing levels of an apex predator and highlight the frequently overlooked importance of trophic interactions in determining large-scale biodiversity patterns. As increased cod abundance was largely driven by changes in fisheries management, our study also shows that management policies and practices, particularly those involving apex predators, can have a strong effect in shaping spatial diversity patterns, and one should not restrict the focus to effects of climate change alone.},

The local stability properties of the resulting food web models were then determined. * 5We found that by choosing interaction strengths using an empirically defined scaling law, the resulting food web models are always dynamically stable, despite the residual uncertainties in the modelling approach. This contrasts with the statistical expectation that random webs with random parameters have a vanishingly improbable chance of stability. * 6The patterning of predator and prey body sizes in real ecosystems affects the arrangement of interaction strengths, which in turn determines food web stability.},

Although such losses are widely viewed as an ethical and aesthetic problem, recent research reveals extensive cascading effects of their disappearance in marine, terrestrial, and freshwater ecosystems worldwide. This empirical work supports long-standing theory about the role of top-down forcing in ecosystems but also highlights the unanticipated impacts of trophic cascades on processes as diverse as the dynamics of disease, wildfire, carbon sequestration, invasive species, and biogeochemical cycles.

  abstract = {Community assembly is central to ecology, yet ecologists have amassed little quantitative information about how food webs assemble. Theory holds that colonisation rate is a primary driver of community assembly. We present new data from a mesocosm experiment to test the hypothesis that colonisation rate also determines the assembly dynamics of food webs. By manipulating colonisation rate and measuring webs through time, we show how colonisation rate governs structural changes during assembly. Webs experiencing different colonisation rates had stable topologies despite significant species turnover, suggesting that some features of network architecture emerge early and change little through assembly. But webs experiencing low colonisation rates showed less variation in the magnitudes of trophic fluxes, and were less likely to develop coupled fast and slow resource channels – a common feature of published webs. Our results reveal that food web structure develops according to repeatable trajectories that are strongly influenced by colonisation rate.},

  abstract = {Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 1055–1071 Abstract Whereas many land predators disappeared before their ecological roles were studied, the decline of marine apex predators is still unfolding. Large sharks in particular have experienced rapid declines over the last decades. In this study, we review the documented changes in exploited elasmobranch communities in coastal, demersal, and pelagic habitats, and synthesize the effects of sharks on their prey and wider communities. We show that the high natural diversity and abundance of sharks is vulnerable to even light fishing pressure. The decline of large predatory sharks reduces natural mortality in a range of prey, contributing to changes in abundance, distribution, and behaviour of small elasmobranchs, marine mammals, and sea turtles that have few other predators. Through direct predation and behavioural modifications, top-down effects of sharks have led to cascading changes in some coastal ecosystems. In demersal and pelagic communities, there is increasing evidence of mesopredator release, but cascading effects are more hypothetical. Here, fishing pressure on mesopredators may mask or even reverse some ecosystem effects. In conclusion, large sharks can exert strong top-down forces with the potential to shape marine communities over large spatial and temporal scales. Yet more empirical evidence is needed to test the generality of these effects throughout the ocean.},

The question remains as to what extent different network properties are related and how understanding this relationship can advance our comprehension of the mechanisms behind these patterns. 3.?Here, we analysed the relationship between nestedness and modularity, two frequently studied network properties, for a large data set of 95 ecological communities including both plant?animal mutualistic and host?parasite networks. 4.?We found that the correlation between nestedness and modularity for a population of random matrices generated from the real communities decreases significantly in magnitude and sign with increasing connectance independent of the network type. At low connectivities, networks that are highly nested also tend to be highly modular; the reverse happens at high connectivities. 5.?The above result is qualitatively robust when different null models are used to infer network structure, but, at a finer scale, quantitative differences exist. We observed an important interaction between the network structure pattern and the null model used to detect it. 6.?A better understanding of the relationship between nestedness and modularity is important given their potential implications on the dynamics and stability of ecological communities.},

Eight sites were trawled in August 1996; then, from a research submersible we videotaped each trawl path and a nearby reference transect to obtain quantitative data. Boulders were displaced, and large epifaunal invertebrates were removed or damaged by a single trawl pass. These structural components of habitat were the dominant features on the seafloor. There was a significant decrease in density, and an increase in damage, to sponges and anthozoans in trawled versus reference transects. Changes in density, or damage to most motile invertebrates were not detected. Delayed mortality, of apparently undamaged invertebrates, may have resulted in greater impact than we detected. Alternatively, over time, some invertebrates may have recovered from any damage previously suffered. A subsequent survey at these sites will address these questions.},

  abstract = {Forage species are key nodes in the energy fluxes between benthic and pelagic zones. The squat lobster, Munida gregaria, is a common forage species of the Southern Hemisphere and its abundance is increasing. This species presents two ecotypes: one (subrugosa) that settles on the sea bottom immediately after the metamorphosis and another (gregaria) that remains in the water column for a variable period of time, before adopting a benthic habit. Hypotheses on its settlement are conflicting; one proposes that it is a density-dependent process of the sea bottom and the other that it is regulated by the availability of pelagic food. To rule out whether feeding factors could be significant in the decision-making process, the first step is to identify whether the ecotypes have different diets or not. This study compared the isotopic niche location, the trophic levels and the reliance on benthic or pelagic resources between ecotypes. Among all sampling events, the isotopic niches of the gregaria and the subrugosa ecotypes were significantly distant from each other. In addition, the difference in δ13C values between ecotypes covered an average of 75\% of the total difference between pelagic and benthic pathways. Benthic individuals relied mostly on benthic animals, while pelagic individuals relied on pelagic primary producers. Overall, results show that each ecotype feeds mainly on different energy pathways. Considering its feeding ecology and movements during life history, M. gregaria is a key component of bentho-pelagic coupling.},

  abstract = {Two of the most important frontal systems of the Argentine Sea (SW Atlantic Ocean) were compared to obtain evidences on the regulatory mechanisms of food web length, incorporating both spatial (areas within fronts) and temporal (presence or absence of frontal structure) variability. The stable isotopes of Carbon and Nitrogen were used to evaluate the origin and composition of the organic matter used by primary consumers, the structure of food webs, the trophic levels of several taxa and the benthic-pelagic coupling within each system. In the Río de la Plata estuarine front, different sources of organic matter would support the food webs occurring in the three areas of the system. The particulate organic material (POM) would be the main resource supporting the food web in the mixohaline area, although with different composition between surface and bottom layers. The similarity of the \textasciitilde d\textsuperscript{13}C signature between the fluvial detritus and the surface POM revealed a strong river-estuary coupling. On the contrary, the salt marsh area did not contribute significantly to POM composition. Consumers of the three areas used both in situ generated and alocthonous resources. A clear division between those species that used planktonic (estuarine or river species) and benthic resources (sea-originated) was observed. Invertebrates such as Acartia tonsa and Neomysis americana were the base of the planktonic food web and canalized most part of the energy present in the system (detritus and POM). The salt marsh contribution to the estuarine system was restricted to crabs from the tidal plain. The trophic level of fish community mostly corresponded to secondary consumers. In the tidal front, there were differences in the POM composition between homogeneous and stratified sectors. Notwithstanding that, the trophic structure was similar between sectors, with variations in the composition of primary consumers. The different signatures of lower consumers were integrated by higher order consumers (fishes). Two trophic pathways (herbivorous and microbial) may dominate in different areas and periods. The fish community was characterized by a higher trophic level (mostly third consumers). The productivity, environmental compartmentation and species diversity affected the trophic structure differently in each front. The structure of the estuarine trophic food web was based on a few dominant species in the lower levels that canalized most part of the energy, a high trophic dependence of these species to fish community and, as a corollary, a classic and short trophic food web stable through time. In the tidal front, the trophic food web presented spatio-temporal fluctuations in the POM composition, a strong benthic-pelagic coupling with a great proportion of fish using benthic preys and a larger food web than in the estuary. This study indicates that high resource availability alone is not an indicator of a longer food web.},

We worked with the fishing fleet operating at Golfo San Jorge with onboard observers over 200 days in 1995-1997, sampling fishery by-catch and entangled birds. Penguins were affected during the austral summer. Estimations of mortality rates showed 0.33\% of the breeding population at Golfo San Jorge is incidentally killed by the shrimp fishery every summer. By-catch in shrimp fishery nets was composed of species important as penguin prey (anchovy and hake) in higher proportions during summer. The daily by-catch of these species was higher than the total calculated daily intake for all penguins breeding in the Golfo San Jorge. This could have a significant effect on birds. We recommend that an observer program be implemented to monitor seabird mortality and that fishing gear should be improved to reduce the indirect effect of the fish by-catch on penguins.},

Fish delivered by Cayenne Terns were significantly smaller than those by Royal Terns.

Here we develop a novel community matrix approach that is                     analogous to the bifurcation method of modular food web theory to show that the                     stability of omnivorous food chains depends critically on interaction strength.                     We find that there are only six possible ways that omnivorous interaction                     strengths can influence the stability of linear food chains. The results from                     these six cases suggest that: (1) strong omnivory is always destabilizing, (2)                     stabilization by weak to intermediate omnivorous interaction strengths dominates                     the set of possible stability responses, and, (3) omnivory can be occasionally                     strictly destabilizing or intermittently destabilizing. We then revisit the                     classical results of Pimm and Lawton to show that although their                     parameterization tends to produce a low percentage of stable omnivorous webs,                     the same parameterization shows strong theoretical support for the weak                     interaction effect. Finally, we end by arguing that our current empirical                     knowledge of omnivory resonates with this general theory.},

Remotely sensed information was combined with on-board observer's data and published information to investigate the role of distinctive oceanographic features in relation to the life cycle of the Patagonian red shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri), main target of the industrial fleet in SJG. Three frontal systems—North, South and Outer SJG—are characterized. The North and South SJG fronts are associated with shrimp reproductive aggregations during late spring and summer. While both function as spawning/nursery grounds, they differ from each other in many respects. The thermohaline South SJG front has its maximum expression during the winter, reflecting the influence of the low-salinity Magellanic Plume, while the thermal North SJG front develops during spring and summer as the water column becomes stratified in the central basin of the gulf. Wind-related down-welling inshore of the front prevails in the North SJG, and upwelling in the South SJG frontal area. Chlorophyll a is concentrated near the thermocline on the stratified side of the North SJG, and for that reason, it is not detected by remote sensors during the spring bloom and the summer but becomes apparent offshore from the location of the front when the thermocline deepens during the fall (May). In the South SJG front, Chl-a concentration is apparent inshore from the front all year-round, related in part to upwelling-mediated resuspension. The northern end of the outer front coincides in time and space with a recurrent non-reproductive aggregation of red shrimp between November and January and is presumably related to foraging. It is argued that keeping the North and South SJG frontal systems off-limits to fishing is a central precautionary requisite for the sustainability of the shrimp fishery.},

Observations were made onboard hake (January 2007) and shrimp vessels (November 2008). The Kelp Gull and Black-browed Albatross were the most frequent and abundant seabirds at both fisheries, while Argentine Hake (Merluccius hubbsi) dominated the composition of discards. Kelp Gulls and Black-browed Albatrosses consumed 91\% of experimentally discarded hake (n~=~1236). Mean sizes of prey consumed by gulls were 22.4 and 23.7~cm in the hake and shrimp fisheries, respectively, while those of prey consumed by albatrosses were 28.5 and 31.3~cm, respectively. In both fisheries, gulls selected the smaller prey available ({$<$}25 and {$<~$}30~cm in hake and shrimp fisheries, respectively) while Black-browed Albatrosses selected the larger prey available ({$>$}25 and {$>$}30~cm in hake and shrimp fisheries, respectively). Intraspecific and interspecific kleptoparasitism were significantly more frequent than expected in Kelp Gulls and Black-browed Albatrosses, respectively. Robbing efficiency was clearly higher in albatrosses than gulls. In both species, sizes of prey consumed by direct capture were significantly smaller than those stolen, and the rate of kleptoparasitism increased with prey size. Gulls stole significantly smaller prey than albatrosses. Prey selection by Kelp Gulls is affected by the interaction with Black-browed Albatrosses, and the degree at which discards are used by both species appears to depend on the fishery considered, the food on offer and the selection of prey sizes according to seabird species-specific preferences.},

Los estudios de dieta son clave para evaluar la contribución relativa del descarte en su ecología trófica, así como empezar a comprender los potenciales efectos de la actividad pesquera sobre sus parámetros reproductivos y dinámica poblacional. El presente estudio analiza la composición dietaria de Gaviotas Cocineras (Larus dominicanus) que reproducen en la costa norte del Golfo San Jorge, Chubut, Argentina, durante la temporada de cría de 2007 en tres localidades de reproducción: Isla Vernacci Sudoeste (45°11’S, 66°31’O), Isla Felipe (45°04’S, 66°19’O) e Isla Laguna (45°02’S, 65°53’O). A su vez se seleccionaron tres períodos de muestreo: incubación, pichones pequeños y pichones grandes. Las muestras de dieta se obtuvieron mediante lavado estomacal. Los resultados obtenidos en las tres colonias analizadas confirman que en las costas del norte de Patagonia la Gaviota Cocinera es una especie generalista y oportunista que durante la temporada reproductiva se alimenta de una amplia variedad de presas, principalmente de peces e invertebrados marinos. Durante la etapa de pichones grandes, la frecuencia de ocurrencia de peces se incrementó mientras que la de poliquetos disminuyó. Los peces fueron las presas más frecuentes en el Golfo San Jorge, representados mayormente por la merluza común (Merluccius hubbsi), una especie de hábitos demersales, y que por lo tanto se encuentra, en general, inaccesible para un depredador de superficie como la Gaviota Cocinera. Es altamente probable que las merluzas comunes provengan mayormente del descarte pesquero. Futuros estudios deberían evaluar los patrones espacio‐temporales en la distribución de las embarcaciones pesqueras y su relación con la proporción de descartes pesqueros en la dieta de las Gaviotas Cocineras.Abstract~∙~Importance of fishery discards in the diet of Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus) at Golfo San Jorge, Patagonia The consumption of fishery discards at sea is currently an important component in the feeding ecology of many gull species. Diet studies are key to assess the relative contribution of discards in their trophic ecology, and to start to understand the potential effects of fishing activities on their breeding parameters and population dynamics. The present study analyzes the dietary composition of Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus) breeding on the northern coast of Golfo San Jorge, Chubut, Argentina, during the 2007 breeding season in three sites: Isla Vernacci Sudoeste (45°11’S, 66°31’O), Isla Felipe (45°04’S, 66°19’O) and Isla Laguna (45°02’S, 65°53’O). Three sampling periods were selected: incubation, small chicks and large chicks. Diet samples were obtained through stomach flushing. The results obtained in the three colonies analyzed confirm that on the northern Patagonian coast the Kelp Gull is a generalist and opportunistic species that feeds during the breeding season on a wide variety of prey, mainly fish and marine invertebrates. During the large chick stage, frequency of occurrence of fish increased while that of polychaetes decreased. Fish were the most frequent prey in the Golfo San Jorge, represented mainly by the Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi), a demersal species that is in general inaccessible for surface predators like the Kelp Gull. It is highly likely that Argentine hake consumed by Kelp Gulls comes mainly from fishing discards. Future studies should evaluate spatio‐temporal patterns in the distribution of fishing vessels and their relation with the proportion of fishery discards in Kelp Gull diet.},

  abstract = {In food webs, many interacting species coexist despite the restrictions imposed by the competitive exclusion principle and apparent competition. For the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations, sustainable coexistence necessitates nonzero determinant of the interaction matrix. Here we show that this requirement is equivalent to demanding that each species be part of a non-overlapping pairing, which substantially constrains the food web structure. We demonstrate that a stable food web can always be obtained if a non-overlapping pairing exists. If it does not, the matrix rank can be used to quantify the lack of niches, corresponding to unpaired species. For the species richness at each trophic level, we derive the food web assembly rules, which specify sustainable combinations. In neighboring levels, these rules allow the higher level to avert competitive exclusion at the lower, thereby incorporating apparent competition. In agreement with data, the assembly rules predict high species numbers at intermediate levels and thinning at the top and bottom. Using comprehensive food web data, we demonstrate how omnivores or parasites with hosts at multiple trophic levels can loosen the constraints and help obtain coexistence in food webs. Hence, omnivory may be the glue that keeps communities intact even under extinction or ecological release of species.},

  abstract = {Bottom trawl fisheries are the most widespread source of anthropogenic physical disturbance to seabed habitats. Development of fisheries-, conservation- and ecosystem-based management strategies requires the selection of indicators of the impact of bottom trawling on the state of benthic biota. Many indicators have been proposed, but no rigorous test of a range of candidate indicators against nine commonly agreed criteria (concreteness, theoretical basis, public awareness, cost, measurement, historical data, sensitivity, responsiveness, specificity) has been performed. Here, we collated data from 41 studies that compared the benthic biota in trawled areas with those in control locations (that were either not trawled or trawled infrequently), examining seven potential indicators (numbers and biomass for individual taxa and whole communities, evenness, Shannon–Wiener diversity and species richness) to assess their performance against the set of nine criteria. The effects of trawling were stronger on whole-community numbers and biomass than for individual taxa. Species richness was also negatively affected by trawling but other measures of diversity were not. Community numbers and biomass met all criteria, taxa numbers and biomass and species richness satisfied most criteria, but evenness and Shannon–Wiener diversity did not respond to trawling and only met few criteria, and hence are not suitable state indicators of the effect of bottom trawling. Synthesis and applications. An evaluation of each candidate indicator against a commonly agreed suite of desirable properties coupled with the outputs of our meta-analysis showed that whole-community numbers of individuals and biomass are the most suitable indicators of bottom trawling impacts as they performed well on all criteria. Strengths of these indicators are that they respond strongly to trawling, relate directly to ecosystem functioning and are straightforward to measure. Evenness and Shannon–Wiener diversity are not responsive to trawling and unsuitable for the monitoring and assessment of bottom trawl impacts.},

  abstract = {Abstract A framework for the description and analysis of multilayer networks is established in statistical physics, and calls are increasing for their adoption by community ecologists. Multilayer networks in community ecology will allow space, time and multiple interaction types to be incorporated into species interaction networks. While the multilayer network framework is applicable to ecological questions, it is one thing to be able to describe ecological communities as multilayer networks and another for multilayer networks to actually prove useful for answering ecological questions. Importantly, documenting multilayer network structure requires substantially greater empirical investment than standard ecological networks. In response, we argue that this additional effort is worthwhile and describe a series of research lines where we expect multilayer networks will generate the greatest impact. Inter-layer edges are the key component that differentiate multilayer networks from standard ecological networks. Inter-layer edges join different networks?termed layers?together and represent ecological processes central to the species interactions studied (e.g., inter-layer edges representing movement for networks separated in space). Inter-layer edges may take a variety of forms, be species- or network-specific, and be measured with a large suite of empirical techniques. Additionally, the sheer size of ecological multilayer networks also requires some changes to empirical data collection around interaction quantification, collaborative efforts and collation in public databases. Network ecology has already touched on a wide swath of ecology and evolutionary biology. Because network stability and patterns of species linkage are the most developed areas of network ecology, they are a natural starting place for multilayer investigations. However, multilayer networks will also provide novel insights to niche partitioning, the connection between traits and species? interactions, and even the geographic mosaic of co-evolution. Synthesis. Multilayer networks provide a formal way to bring together the study of species interaction networks and the processes that influence them. However, describing inter-layer edges and the increasing amounts of data required represent challenges. The pay-off for added investment will be ecological networks that describe the composition and capture the dynamics of ecological communities more completely and, consequently, have greater power for understanding the patterns and processes that underpin diversity in ecological communities. A plain language summary is available for this article.},

  abstract = {* 1A fundamental goal of ecological network research is to understand how the complexity observed in nature can persist and how this affects ecosystem functioning. This is essential for us to be able to predict, and eventually mitigate, the consequences of increasing environmental perturbations such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasions of exotic species. * 2Ecological networks can be subdivided into three broad types: ‘traditional’ food webs, mutualistic networks and host–parasitoid networks. There is a recent trend towards cross-comparisons among network types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed to phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of network configurations, such as compartments, allows us to explore the role of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic networks and host–parasitoid networks, and of body size in food webs. * 3Research into ecological networks has recently undergone a renaissance, leading to the production of a new catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved, and quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been unearthed and it is increasingly evident that it is the distribution of interaction strengths and the configuration of complexity, rather than just its magnitude, that governs network stability and structure. * 4Another significant advance is the growing recognition of the importance of individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all, occur between individuals. The new generation of high-quality networks is now enabling us to move away from describing networks based on species-averaged data and to start exploring patterns based on individuals. Such refinements will enable us to address more general ecological questions relating to foraging theory and the recent metabolic theory of ecology. * 5We conclude by suggesting a number of ‘dead ends’ and ‘fruitful avenues’ for future research into ecological networks.},

  abstract = {Abstract Globally, sharks are impacted by a wide range of human activities, resulting in many populations being depleted. Trophy large-sized sharks of the Argentinean coast, the sand-tiger Carcharias taurus , the copper Carcharhinus brachyurus and the sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus are under intense sport and artisanal fishing since the 50's decade. However, the current and historical information for the assessment of its populations status is scarce. The aim of this work was to analyze the status of conservation of these species through the gathering of expert fishermen knowledge (FK) on semi-structured interviews. Abundance variation perception between the beginning and the end of fishermen careers revealed a critical status for the species study (means variation between -77 and -90 \%). Furthermore, a best day's catch analysis reinforce this result in the case of the sand tiger shark. The school shark Galeorhinus galeus was included on this work with the objective of contrast FK with formal information available of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) time series. Both sources of information, despite are not comparable, shows declines \textasciitilde{} - 80\%. The critical conservation situation of study species needs urgent management action, particularly for the san tiger shark which could became regionally extinct before the reaction of stakeholders occurs.           ,              Resumen A escala global, los condrictios se encuentran severamente afectados por un amplio rango de actividades antrópicas. Actualmente una gran proporción de poblaciones se encuentran diezmadas y algunas especies son consideradas en peligro de extinción. Los tiburones de gran tamaño y de interés pesquero de la costa Argentina, el escalandrún Carcharias taurus , el bacota Carcharhinus brachyurus y el gatopardo Notorynchus cepedianus se encuentran bajo una intensa presión de pesca desde la década del 50. Sin embargo, la información actual o histórica sobre el estado de conservación de estas especies es muy escasa. El objetivo de este trabajo fue analizar el estado de conservación de estas especies a través de la colecta de conocimiento de pescadores expertos mediante entrevistas semi-estructuradas. La precepción de los pescadores sobre la variación en abundancia entre el principio de sus carreras y el final de las mismas, mostró un estado crítico de las especies de estudio (variación media entre -77 y -90\%). Además, un análisis sobre el mejor día de capturas revela un estado particularmente crítico para el eslandrún. El cazón Galeorhinus galeus fue incluido en este trabajo con el objetivo de contrastar los resultados de la percepción de los pescadores con información formal disponible basada en información de Captura por Unidad de Esfuerzo. En ambas fuentes de información, si bien no son comparables, se obtuvo una declinación del 80 \% en la abundancia. Adicionalmente, en este trabajo se recabo información sobre los patrones estacionales de ocurrencia de las especies (adultos y neonatos). El crítico estado de conservación de las especies de estudio requiere la aplicación de mediadas de manejo urgentes, especialmente para el escalandrún que podría extinguirse regionalmente antes de que reaccionen usuarios u organismos de manejo.},

We investigated habitat use, seasonal patterns of abundance and population structure of the broadnose sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus in the marine temperate environment of a northern Patagonian bay (Argentina). We expected N. cepedianus to exhibit strong seasonality in the bay driven by the seasonal occurrence of important marine mammal prey. However, an alternative or complementary hypothesis arose from the possibility that N. cepedianus uses the area seasonally as mating grounds. To explore these hypotheses, a suite of baited remote underwater video stations and catch per unit effort data indices were used to estimate the seasonal relative abundance of the species inside the bay. Reproductive hormone levels were measured to determine reproductive status and maturity stages of the population. Results indicated that N. cepedianus uses the bay year-round, showing a peak abundance during spring when individuals aggregate, likely for feeding and mating purposes. Male and female total lengths at maturity were 170 and 190 cm, respectively. Contrary to other studies in the Southwest Atlantic, population composition remained similar throughout the seasons, with adults dominating over juveniles, and adult females prevailing in the population at all times. Considering the historical abundance decline recently reported for the species, protection and enforcement within protected areas across the Southwest Atlantic must remain of high priority in government initiatives.},

  abstract = {Abstract Models of complex systems with n components typically have order n2 parameters because each component can potentially interact with every other. When it is impractical to measure these parameters, one may choose random parameter values and study the emergent statistical properties at the system level. Many influential results in theoretical ecology have been derived from two key assumptions: that species interact with random partners at random intensities and that intraspecific competition is comparable between species. Under these assumptions, community dynamics can be described by a community matrix that is often amenable to mathematical analysis. We combine empirical data with mathematical theory to show that both of these assumptions lead to results that must be interpreted with caution. We examine 21 empirically derived community matrices constructed using three established, independent methods. The empirically derived systems are more stable by orders of magnitude than results from random matrices. This consistent disparity is not explained by existing results on predator-prey interactions. We investigate the key properties of empirical community matrices that distinguish them from random matrices. We show that network topology is less important than the relationship between a species’ trophic position within the food web and its interaction strengths. We identify key features of empirical networks that must be preserved if random matrix models are to capture the features of real ecosystems.},

  abstract = {We review the effects of fishing on benthic fauna, habitat, diversity, community structure and trophic interactions in tropical, temperate and polar marine environments and consider whether it is possible to predict or manage fishing-induced changes in marine ecosystems. Such considerations are timely given the disillusionment with some fishery management strategies and that policy makers need a scientific basis for deciding whether they should respond to social, economic and political demands for instituting or preventing ecosystem-based management. Fishing has significant direct and indirect effects on habitat, and on the diversity, structure and productivity of benthic communities. These effects are most readily identified and last longest in those areas that experience infrequent natural disturbance. The initiation of fishing in an unfished system leads to dramatic changes in fish community structure. As fishing intensity increases the additional effects are more difficult to detect. Fishing has accelerated and magnified natural declines in the abundance of many forage fishes and this has lead to reduced reproductive success and abundance in birds and marine mammals. However, such donor-controlled dynamics are less apparent in food webs where fishes are the top predators since their feeding strategies are rather more plastic than those of most birds and mammals. Fishers tend to target species in sequence as a fishery develops and this leads to changes in the composition of the fished communities with time. The dramatic and apparently compensatory shifts in the biomass of different species in many fished ecosystems have often been driven by environmental change rather than the indirect effects of fishing. Indeed, in most pelagic systems, species replacements would have occurred, albeit less rapidly, in the absence of fishing pressure. In those cases when predator or prey species fill a key role, fishing can have dramatic indirect effects on community structure. Thus fishing has shifted some coral reef ecosystems to alternate stable states because there is tight predator–prey coupling between invertebrate feeding fishes and sea urchins. Fishing has reduced, and locally extirpated, populations of predatory fishes. These reductions do not have a consistent effect on the abundance and diversity of their prey: environmental processes control prey populations in some systems, whereas top-down processes are more important in others. By-catch which is discarded during fishing activities may sustain populations of scavenging species, particularly seabirds. We conclude by identifying the circumstances in which new research is needed to guide managers and stress the importance of unfished control sites for studies of fishing effects. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of closed area management (marine reserves) and the conditions under which such management is likely to provide benefits for the fishery or ecosystem.}

  abstract = {. Fishing has wide-ranging impacts on marine ecosystems. One of the most pervasive signs of intensive fishing is "fishing down the food web", with landings increasingly dominated by smaller species from lower trophic levels. Decreases in the trophic level of landings are assumed to reflect those in fish communities, because size-selective mortality causes decreases in the relative abundance of larger species and in mean body size within species. However, existing analyses of fishing impacts on the trophic level of fish communities have focused on the role of changes in species composition rather than size composition. This will provide a biased assessment of the magnitude of fishing impacts, because fishes feed at different trophic levels as they grow. Here, we combine body size versus trophic level relationships for North Sea fishes (trophic level assessed using nitrogen stable-isotope analysis) with species–size–abundance data from two time-series of trawl-survey data (whole North Sea 1982–2000, central and northern North Sea 1925–1996) to predict long-term trends in the trophic structure of the North Sea fish community. Analyses of the 1982–2000 time-series showed that there was a slow but progressive decline in the trophic level of the demersal community, while there was no trend in the trophic level of the combined pelagic and demersal community. Analyses of the longer time-series suggested that there was no trend in the trophic level of the demersal community. We related temporal changes in trophic level to temporal changes in the slopes of normalised biomass size-spectra (which theoretically represent the trophic structure of the community), mean log2 body mass and mean log2 maximum body mass. While the size-based metrics of community structure showed long-term trends that were consistent with the effects of increased fishery exploitation, these trends were only correlated with trophic level for the demersal community. Our analysis suggests that the effects of fishing on the trophic structure of fish communities can be much more complex than previously assumed. This is a consequence of sampled communities not reflecting all the pathways of energy transfer in a marine ecosystem and of the absence of historical data on temporal and spatial changes in the trophic level of individuals. For the North Sea fish community, changes in size structure due to the differential effects of fishing on species and populations with different life histories are a stronger and more universal indicator of fishing effects than changes in mean trophic level.},

  abstract = {Fishing affects patterns of energy use in fish populations, as demonstrated by changes in population energy consumption and the size and age when energy demands are greatest. We compare theoretical predictions and observed patterns of energy use (expressed as the primary production required to support fish production) by North Sea fish, based on simple and widely applicable theory that links life history parameters, fishing mortality (F), trophic transfer efficiency and relationships between size and trophic level (as determined using nitrogen stable isotope analysis). For the demersal species that dominate total biomass, relationships between size and trophic level were quite consistent among years. There were large decreases in relative energy requirements of all exploited demersal populations except plaice Pleuronectes platessa during the last 3 to 4~decades. Relative energy requirements of plaice were more stable because smaller plaice, which now dominate the exploited population, feed at higher trophic levels than larger plaice. The sizes and ages when population energy demands were greatest fell with increasing fishing mortality and differences between the predicted (F=0) and observed ages at maximum energy demand were greater in larger species. Currently, the energy demands of most species peak early in life (1–3~years) and largely reflect patterns of recruitment, leading to a homogenisation of the trophodynamics of the fish community. The fate of energy that is no longer used by commercially exploited species is not clear, partly because of the infrequent and untargeted monitoring of species that are more resilient to fishing. However, we conducted a preliminary assessment of the energy demands of solenette Buglossidium luteum, a very abundant small flatfish in the central North Sea that has increased in abundance in recent years. The solenette's high abundance and resilience to fishing, suggests that it now requires 35\% of primary production in part of the central North Sea, energy that may have supported larger species in a less heavily fished ecosystem.},

Both theory and simulations of current models predict the onset of instability with growing size and complexity, so for decades it has been conjectured that ecosystems must have some unidentified structural property exempting them from this outcome. We show that trophic coherence—a hitherto ignored feature of food webs that current structural models fail to reproduce—is a better statistical predictor of linear stability than size or complexity. Furthermore, we prove that a maximally coherent network with constant interaction strengths will always be linearly stable. We also propose a simple model that, by correctly capturing the trophic coherence of food webs, accurately reproduces their stability and other basic structural features. Most remarkably, our model shows that stability can increase with size and complexity. This suggests a key to May’s paradox, and a range of opportunities and concerns for biodiversity conservation.},

Most seabirds occupy wide breeding distributional ranges, and dissimilar ecological settings may result in distinct environmental pressures on males and females leading to geographical differences in sexual segregation. Using GPS loggers and stable isotope analysis of whole blood (δ15N, δ13C), we assessed the occurrence of sexual differences in Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus) foraging trip parameters, habitat use, isotopic niche and diet during the incubation period at three breeding locations in Argentina characterized by different foraging contexts. At Islote Arroyo Jabalí Este, sexual differences were found in trip parameters and habitat use mainly associated with a significantly higher use by males of a refuse dump as foraging site. However, their isotopic niches were similar with both sexes consuming mostly recreational fish waste, suggesting it was mainly obtained by males at the dump and by females at shoreline areas used by fishers. At Punta Tombo, there were no sex differences in trip parameters nor in the main prey consumed consisting of fishery discards, although females used more shoreline areas and males presented a significantly larger isotopic niche width. In contrast, at Isla Vernaci Este, males and females showed similar trip parameters, habitat use, and isotopic niche width and diet composition. Results show geographical differences in the degree of sexual segregation, which may result from differences in the availability of local food resources, particularly anthropogenic food subsidies.},

Our results suggest that non-trophic interactions exhibit highly nonrandom structures both alone and with respect to food web structure. The occurrence of different types of interactions, relative to all possible links, was well predicted by trophic structure and simple traits of the source and target species. In this community, competition for space and positive interactions related to habitat/refuge provisioning by sessile and/or basal species were by far the most abundant non-trophic interactions. If these patterns are corroborated in other ecosystems, they may suggest potentially important dynamic constraints on the combined architecture of trophic and non-trophic interactions. The nonrandom patterning of non-trophic interactions suggests a path forward for developing a more comprehensive ecological network theory to predict the functioning and resilience of ecological communities.},

Here, we investigated how spatial patterns in food‐web structure are associated with environmental gradients in the Barents Sea, a highly productive shelf sea of the Arctic Ocean. We compared food webs from 25 subregions in the Barents Sea and examined spatial correlations among food‐web metrics, and between metrics and spatial variability in seawater temperature, bottom depth and number of days with ice cover. Several food‐web metrics were positively associated with seawater temperature: connectance, level of omnivory, clustering, cannibalism, and high variability in generalism, while other food‐web metrics such as modularity and vulnerability were positively associated with sea ice and negatively with temperature. Food‐web metrics positively associated with habitat heterogeneity were: number of species, link density, omnivory, path length, and trophic level. This finding suggests that habitat heterogeneity promotes food‐web complexity in terms of number of species and link density. Our analyses reveal that spatial variation in food‐web structure along the environmental gradients is partly related to species turnover. However the higher interaction turnover compared to species turnover along these gradients indicates a consistent modification of food‐web structure, implying that interacting species may co‐vary in space. In conclusion, our study shows how environmental heterogeneity, via environmental filtering, influences not only turnover in species composition, but also the structure of food webs over large spatial scales.},

Yet, temporal studies of highly resolved food web structure are scarce. With few exceptions, most temporal food web studies are either too simplified, preventing a detailed assessment of structural properties, or binary, missing the temporal dynamics of energy fluxes among species. Using long-term, multi-trophic biomass data coupled with highly resolved information on species feeding relationships, we analyzed food web dynamics in the Gulf of Riga (Baltic Sea) over more than three decades (1981-2014). We combined unweighted (topology-based) and weighted (biomass- and flux-based) food web approaches, first, to unravel how distinct descriptors can highlight differences (or similarities) in food web dynamics through time, and second, to compare temporal dynamics of food web structure and function. We find that food web descriptors vary substantially and distinctively through time, likely reflecting different underlying ecosystem processes. While node- and link-weighted metrics reflect changes related to alterations in species dominance and fluxes, unweighted metrics are more sensitive to changes in species and link richness. Comparing unweighted, topology-based metrics and flux-based functions further indicates that temporal changes in functions cannot be predicted using unweighted food web structure. Rather, information on species population dynamics and weighted, flux-based networks should be included to better comprehend temporal food web dynamics. By integrating unweighted, node- and link-weighted metrics, we here demonstrate how different approaches can be used to compare food web structure and function, and identify complementary patterns of change in temporal food web dynamics, which enables a more complete understanding of the ecological processes at play in ecosystems undergoing change.},

Warming strengthened trophic cascades from fish to primary producers, and it decreased the impact of eutrophication on the mean and temporal variation of phytoplankton biomass. These impacts varied seasonally, with higher temperatures leading to stronger trophic cascades in winter and weaker algae blooms under eutrophication in summer. Our results suggest that higher temperatures may shift the control of primary production in freshwater ponds toward stronger top-down and weaker bottom-up effects. The dampened temporal variability of algal biomass under eutrophication at higher temperatures suggests that warming may stabilize some ecosystem processes.},

  abstract = {Abstract 1 Models for predicting ecological behaviour typically require large volumes of data for parameterisation, which is a problem because data are scarce. Qualitative modelling (QM) provides an alternative by exploring the entire range of possible parameter values. When a parameter value is completely unknown, QM typically invokes the Principle of Indifference (PoI), for example by sampling the parameter from a uniform prior distribution However, if PoI is invoked in this probabilistic way, there may be multiple possible methods for defining a parameter space and sampling values from it, and, worryingly two different but equally defensible methods can lead to different predictions about ecosystem responses. 2 We investigated how probabilistic PoI can give rise to problems in QM, and developed an alternative method based on Boolean PoI that does not suffer the same limitations We used a case study that involved predicting the responses of multiple species to the suppression of a pest. The unknown model parameters were interaction strengths between species. For the standard probabilistic method, we drew the parameters randomly from uniform (PoI) and other distributions. For our new Boolean PoI method, we instead simply specified the ranges of ?possible? parameter values, and developed a Boolean analysis technique to summarise model predictions. 3 As expected, invoking probabilistic QM yielded diff erent predictions (species response probabilities) for different but equally defensible parameterisation and sampling schemes Sometimes differences were large enough to impact decision making. In contrast, our new Boolean PoI approach simply classifies outcomes (species responses) as certain, possible, or impossible. Encouragingly, some species responses that were not consistently resolved under probabilistic PoI were shown by our method to be in fact governed by simple rules. Our method can also identify key species whose responses determine whole-system outcomes. 4 Our non-probabilistic representation of uncertainty circumvents the philosophical problems in standard implementations of PoI for QM. Our Boolean analysis method summarises results in a way that is interpretable and potentially useful to conservation decision makers. A priority for future research is to increase the efficiency of our Boolean approach to allow it to deal with problems of higher complexity (more interactions).

  abstract = {Effect sizes are the most important outcome of empirical studies. Most articles on effect sizes highlight their importance to communicate the practical significance of results. For scientists themselves, effect sizes are most useful because they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be used to determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining effects across studies. This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.},

Nevertheless, our lives are strongly based on services provided by ecosystems, thus the responses to global change of our natural heritage are of immediate concern. Understanding the relationship between complexity and stability of ecosystems is of key importance for the maintenance of the balance of human growth and the conservation of all the natural services that ecosystems provide. Mathematical network models can be used to simplify the vast complexity of the real world, to formally describe and investigate ecological phenomena, and to understand ecosystems propensity of returning to its functioning regime after a stress or a perturbation. The use of ecological-network models to study the relationship between complexity and stability of natural ecosystems is the focus of this review. The concept of ecological networks and their characteristics are first introduced, followed by central and occasionally contrasting definitions of complexity and stability. The literature on the relationship between complexity and stability in different types of models and in real ecosystems is then reviewed, highlighting the theoretical debate and the lack of consensual agreement. The summary of the importance of this line of research for the successful management and conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services concludes the review.},

P. guntheri also had a moderately diverse zooplankton diet, especially copepods, and benthos and squid damaged by the fishery. The diet of P. tessellata was the most diverse and was mainly benthos, including damaged scallops, with some euphausiids and amphipods. Feeding niche overlap of fish between 10 and 20 cm TL for the three species was between 5.8 and 9.2\% for each pair of species, indicating relatively little overlap even though all species scavenged on organisms made available by the fishery. Thus the diet of these three Patagonotothen species indicates substantial feeding niche separation, and that the three species are moderately specialised feeders.},

However, the effects of over-fishing, environmental change, fish community dynamics and other factors that have altered the trophic ecology of cod are not well understood. We present an analysis of the trophic patterns of cod in the northeast US shelf ecosystem from a 25 yr time series of food habits data. Additionally, we compared the diet of this species with the spatio-temporal distribution of its prey species and evaluated prey preference over time. Atlantic cod exhibit an omnivorous diet; we assessed the temporal, spatial, and ontogenetic trends in this diet by examination of {$>$}15000 stomachs. Ontogenetic shifts in diet were observed; early juveniles consumed more pelagic than benthic invertebrates, medium cod consumed benthic invertebrates and fish, and larger cod consumed larger amounts of fish. Cannibalism also increased with ontogeny. Diet shifted significantly over a period of 3 decades, concurrent with changes in forage species abundance and distribution. Most of the major prey species were eaten in periods when they had high spatio-temporal overlap with cod and were abundant, indicating opportunistic feeding by cod. Similar to many other ecosystems, cod prefer sand lance, Cancer spp. crabs and herring, regardless of the abundance or spatio-temporal overlap with these prey species. It is unclear whether the observed changes in the trophic dynamics of cod have broad implications for cod populations, yet the evidence does suggest that cod are not likely to influence the abundance and distribution of their prey populations in this ecosystem.},

  abstract = {More recent and extensive food web studies have questioned some of the prevailing paradigms of food web theory. Yet with few exceptions, most food webs and associated metrics are reported for freshwater or terrestrial systems. I analyzed the food web of the Northeast US Shelf ecosystem across a large spatial and temporal extent. This speciose food web exhibits a predator:prey ratio (0.95) and percentage of intermediate species (89\%) similar to most other food webs. Other statistics, such as the percentage of omnivory (62\%), percentage of cannibalistic species (31\%), number of cycles (5\%), and the total number of links (L; 1562) and species (S; 81) are similar to more recent and extensively studied food webs. Finally, this food web exhibits a linkage density (L/S; 19.3), connectivity (C; 48.2\%), and Lyapunov stability proxy (S × C; 39.1) that are an order of magnitude higher than other webs or are disproportionate to the number of species observed in this system. Although the exact S and C relationship is contentious, the connectivity of food webs with more than 40 species is approximately 10\%, which is very different from the near 50\% observed for this ecosystem. The openness of marine ecosystems, lack of specialists, long lifespans, and large size changes across the life histories of many marine species can collectively make marine food webs more highly connected than their terrestrial and freshwater counterparts, contrary to food web theory. Changes in connectivity also have ramifications for ecosystem functioning and Lyapunov stability. The high connectivity of this food web and the mathematical determinants for stability are consistent with the weak nature of species interactions that have been observed and that are required for system persistence. Yet the historically high exploitation rates of marine organisms obfuscate our understanding of marine food web stability. It is possible that marine food webs are inherently very different from their terrestrial or freshwater counterparts, implying the need for modified paradigms of food web theory.},

A few shallow-water species occur in massive pelagic swarms during a specificontogenetic phase or during their entire life. These swarms are often associated with fronts or internalwaves. In deep waters the occurrence of squat lobsters is determined by the availability of foodsources such as organic matter falls or seeps. Some squat lobster species oxyregulate and can copewith low oxygen environments. This ability changes ontogenetically, with the oldest/largest animalsbeing best capable of surviving these extreme conditions. Air exposure as a consequence of fishingactivities can cause physiological stress and increase mortality rates. Squat lobsters consume manydifferent food resources, as deposit feeders, predators, scavengers, carnivorous, algal grazers,suspension feeders or even cannibals. They obtain carbon and nitrogen from different sources:photosynthetic, chemosynthetic or mixed. Feeding rates of squat lobsters vary on daily, seasonal andannual time scales, and oxygen consumption during digestion depends on the ingested food types.Squat lobsters play an important role as recyclers in many sedimentary ecosystems, either by reincorporatingorganic matter into the food web or by producing highly nutritive faeces. Feeding onprimary producers, bacteria or detritus, and being consumed by several top predators, squat lobstersrepresent a direct trophic short-cut in many marine food webs.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the food web structure and complexity are central to better understand ecosystem functioning. A food-web approach includes both species and energy flows among them, providing a natural framework for characterizing species’ ecological roles and the mechanisms through which biodiversity influences ecosystem dynamics. Here we present for the first time a high-resolution food web for a marine ecosystem at Potter Cove (northern Antarctic Peninsula). Eleven food web properties were analyzed in order to document network complexity, structure and topology. We found a low linkage density (3.4), connectance (0.04) and omnivory percentage (45), as well as a short path length (1.8) and a low clustering coefficient (0.08). Furthermore, relating the structure of the food web to its dynamics, an exponential degree distribution (in- and out-links) was found. This suggests that the Potter Cove food web may be vulnerable if the most connected species became locally extinct. For two of the three more connected functional groups, competition overlap graphs imply high trophic interaction between demersal fish and niche specialization according to feeding strategies in amphipods. On the other hand, the prey overlap graph shows also that multiple energy pathways of carbon flux exist across benthic and pelagic habitats in the Potter Cove ecosystem. Although alternative food sources might add robustness to the web, network properties (low linkage density, connectance and omnivory) suggest fragility and potential trophic cascade effects.},

One such property is the small-world topology that combines a high clustering and a small distance between nodes of the network. This property may increase food web resilience but make them more sensitive to the extinction of connected species. Food web theory has been developed principally from freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, largely omitting marine habitats. If theory needs to be modified to accommodate observations from marine ecosystems, based on major differences in several topological characteristics is still on debate. Here we investigated if the small-world topology is a common structural pattern in marine food webs. We developed a novel, simple and statistically rigorous method to examine the largest set of complex marine food webs to date. More than half of the analyzed marine networks exhibited a similar or lower characteristic path length than the random expectation, whereas 39\% of the webs presented a significantly higher clustering than its random counterpart. Our method proved that 5 out of 28 networks fulfilled both features of the small-world topology: short path length and high clustering. This work represents the first rigorous analysis of the small-world topology and its associated features in high-quality marine networks. We conclude that such topology is a structural pattern that is not maximized in marine food webs; thus it is probably not an effective model to study robustness, stability and feasibility of marine ecosystems.},

We here summarize metrics used to describe patterns of ecological interactions that account for the overall community architecture, such as nestedness and modularity. In addition, we discuss approaches to characterize species topological roles within food webs in order to identify sets of interacting species that act as the backbone of marine biodiversity and ecosystem functions. We argue that combining empirical data and dynamic network modeling is key to foster the integrative understanding of ecological, evolutionary, and anthropogenic processes shaping marine food webs, which requires theoretical ecologists and practitioners to work together in long-term, system-level strategies to conserve marine biodiversity and improve the sustainability of fisheries.},

The time mean circulation is dominated by a cyclonic gyre bounded by a relatively strong coastal current and, on its offshore side, by the Patagonia Current. The gulf circulation varies significantly with season. Tidal mixing during the summer months generates baroclinic pressure gradients that allow development of a cyclonic gyre in the southern region. During winter, erosion of density gradients weakens the cyclonic tendency and a large anticyclonic gyre develops in the southern region. Atmospheric heat fluxes regulate the transition between summer and winter circulation patterns. Analysis of process-oriented experiments indicates that summer circulation is mainly driven by the interaction between tides and stratification while winter circulation is mainly driven by wind forcing. The mass exchanges between the gulf and the open shelf peak during the summer due to a larger onshore penetration of the Patagonia Current. During winter, these exchanges are very weak and remain largely confined to the northern portion of the gulf.]}

A total of 1,255 stomachs of Brazilian flathead, Percophis brasiliensis, caught on commercial fleet vessels in the Argentine-Uruguayan Coastal Ecosystem between November 2008 and December 2009 was analyzed. 657 (52.4\%) had content and 598 (47.6\%) were empty. According to the Index of Relative Importance the species consumed, mainly, bony fishes (98.56\%) followed by molluscs (1.37\%) and crustaceans (0.05\%). The most important preys were Trachurus lathami, (64.63\%), Engraulis anchoita (27.37\%) and squid Loligo sanpaulensis (1.36\%). The increase of preys size was proportional to the predator length growth. The 4.25 trophic level value positions Percophis brasiliensis as a tertiary piscivorous consumer.},

Differently from previous studies, our analysis did not relied on randomized networks with specific a priori assumptions, which has been demonstrated to produce inconsistent patterns. We aimed to evaluate the interplay between population dynamics and food-web topology, and its consequences to module occurrences in complex food-webs. We evaluated 13 arrangements of three-species modules and 199 arrangements of four-species modules. For each module, we assembled, a corresponding Jacobian predation matrix, and evaluated the arrangements expected to persist after a disturbance in the equilibrium of the populations dynamics (local stability). Our general results were that (1) a limited set of stable arrangements occurs most frequently; (2) the omnivory module is the only three-species module expected to occur both in the stable and unstable region; (3) connectance and omnivory affects the proportion of stable modules; and (4) the type of ecosystem influence the proportion of stable modules. Further, we demonstrated that food-web topology and population dynamics influenced module occurrences in natural communities; presented a function for the ways that local stability increases the probability of module occurrence; and highlighted the use of omnivory degree to access the effect of feeding at more than one trophic level on food-web stability.},

  abstract = {We reconstructed the structure of a tropical marine food web and then analyzed it to evaluate how the trophic network could respond to anthropogenic pressures such as the removal of species by fisheries. To reconstruct the presence/absence of predator-prey interactions, we assembled detailed quantitative information from the scientific literature on the stomach contents of 80 predator species (elasmobranchs, teleosts and invertebrates) collected in the Golfo de Tortugas (Colombia) between 1990 and 2009. We tested three conceptual models of network structure (random, small-world, and scale-free), characterized by different system properties and tolerance to perturbations, to evaluate which one better fitted the reconstructed food web. Our results suggest that this network has small-world structure and scale-free properties. An impact on one species may therefore spread to many species through short interaction chains; only a few nodes with high centrality values would support the network structure. However, contrary to current theory, our analysis revealed no clear relationships between species with high centrality and the large-scale structural patterns observed in the network (small-world and scale-free properties). This observation indicates that ecosystem-based fisheries management should prioritize not only high-centrality species (e.g., shrimps, which furthermore are species of high commercial value in the area), but should also consider species with unique structural properties such as those with little or no topological redundancy such as large sharks. For this reason, top predator conservation needs more attention than currently received in fisheries management.},

Here we analyse two Antarctic ecosystems for which the interaction strengths are obtained: (1) directly, from independently measured material fluxes, (2) for the complete ecosystem and (3) with a close match between species and ‘trophic groups’. We analyse the role of recycling, predation and competition and find that ecosystem stability can be estimated by the strengths of the shortest positive and negative predator-prey feedbacks in the network. We show the generality of our explanation with another 21 observed food webs, comparing random-type parameterisations of interaction strengths with empirical ones. Our results show how functional relationships dominate over average-network topology. They make clear that the classic complexity-instability paradox is essentially an artificial interaction-strength result.},

In the past decades, there has been a shift from focussing on determining the number of interactions to taking into account their relative strengths. The question is: How do the strengths of the interactions determine the stability of a community? Recently, a metric has been proposed which compares the stability of observed communities in terms of the strength of three- and two-link feedback loops (cycles of interaction strengths). However, it has also been suggested that we do not need to go beyond the pairwise structure of interactions to capture stability. Here, we directly compare the performance of the feedback and pairwise metrics. Using observed food-web structures, we show that the pairwise metric does not work as a comparator of stability and is many orders of magnitude away from the actual stability values. We argue that metrics based on pairwise-strength information cannot capture the complex organization of strong and weak links in a community, which is essential for system stability.},

We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

  abstract = {Ecological communities are constantly being reshaped in the face of environmental change and anthropogenic pressures. Yet, how food webs change over time remains poorly understood. Food web science is characterized by a trade-off between complexity (in terms of the number of species and feeding links) and dynamics. Topological analysis can use complex, highly resolved empirical food web models to explore the architecture of feeding interactions but is limited to a static view, whereas ecosystem models can be dynamic but use highly aggregated food webs. Here, we explore the temporal dynamics of a highly resolved empirical food web over a time period of 18 years, using the German Bight fish and benthic epifauna community as our case study. We relied on long-term monitoring ecosystem surveys (from 1998 to 2015) to build a metaweb, i.e. the meta food web containing all species recorded over the time span of our study. We then combined time series of species abundances with topological network analysis to construct annual food web snapshots. We developed a new approach, ‘node-weighted’ food web metrics by including species abundances to represent the temporal dynamics of food web structure, focusing on generality and vulnerability. Our results suggest that structural food web properties change through time; however, binary food web structural properties may not be as temporally variable as the underlying changes in species composition. Further, the node-weighted metrics enabled us to detect that food web structure was influenced by changes in species composition during the first half of the time series and more strongly by changes in species dominance during the second half. Our results demonstrate how ecosystem surveys can be used to monitor temporal changes in food web structure, which are important ecosystem indicators for building marine management and conservation plans.},

Field observations confirmed that trawling reduced the density of important bioturbators in the study area, but revealed only weak effects of trawling on nutrient fluxes. The importance of the decline in bioturbators was demonstrated in the mesocosm experiments where the density of four key bioturbators (Brissopsis lyrifera, Nuculana minuta, Calocaris macandreae and Amphiura chiajei) showed significant correlations with nutrient flux. All four species caused an increase in the rate at which silicate was released from the sediment, but their effect on nitrogen cycling were species specific. Bioturbators that bulldoze through the sediment (B. lyrifera and N. minuta) increased the loss of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) from the sediment, whereas those that irrigate burrows within the sediment (C. macandreae and A. chiajei) caused increased uptake of DIN. This shows that the activities of the species present can determine whether the seabed acts as a source or a sink of nitrogen nutrients. By combining these experimental results with field observations of bioturbator abundances, we demonstrate the potential impacts of trawling on benthic ecosystem function. Due to the world-wide extent of intensive bottom-trawling, such effects may be globally significant and affect the nutrient balance especially in continental shelf and coastal areas.},

Results showed that M. schmitti is a mesocarnivorous with a mean trophic level of 3.58. The diet was based mostly on crustaceans (decapods, stomatopods, isopods and amphipods), polychaetes, fishes and cephalopods, in a decreasing order of importance. The diet varied between juveniles and adults, and between individuals captured by the trawling fishery and sport anglers. Crabs were the main prey item observed in the stomach of individuals caught by anglers while the shrimp Pleoticus muelleri was the most consumed prey by individuals caught as by-catch. Juveniles consumed more polychaetes than adults, while the latter consumed mostly shrimp. The presence of shrimp in stomach contents of M. schmitti caught by the commercial fishery is evidence of a trophic interaction between M. schmitti and the fishery. The interaction may be due to the shark and the fleet targeting the same resource, or due to the shark using the discarded shrimp as a food source.},

  abstract = {This contribution, which reviews some broad trends in human history and in the history of fishing, argues that sustainability, however defined, rarely if ever occurred as a result of an explicit policy, but as result of our inability to access a major part of exploited stocks. With the development of industrial fishing, and the resulting invasion of the refuges previously provided by distance and depth, our interactions with fisheries resources have come to resemble the wars of extermination that newly arrived hunters conducted 40 000–50 000 years ago in Australia, and 11 000–13 000 years ago against large terrestrial mammals arrived in North America. These broad trends are documented here through a map of change in fish sizes, which displays characteristic declines, first in the nearshore waters of industrialized countries of the Northern Hemisphere, then spread offshore and to the Southern Hemisphere. This geographical extension met its natural limit in the late 1980s, when the catches from newly accessed stocks ceased to compensate for the collapse in areas accessed earlier, hence leading to a gradual decline of global landing. These trends affect developing countries more than the developed world, which have been able to meet the shortfall by increasing imports from developing countries. These trends, however, together with the rapid growth of farming of carnivorous fishes, which consumes other fishes suited for human consumption, have led to serious food security issues. This promotes urgency to the implementation of the remedies traditionally proposed to alleviate overfishing (reduction of overcapacity, enforcement of conservative total allowable catches, etc.), and to the implementation of non–conventional approaches, notably the re–establishment of the refuges (also known as marine reserves), which made possible the apparent sustainability of pre–industrial fisheries.},

The fractions of intermediate (76\%), omnivorous (49\%) and cannibalistic (8\%) nodes are slightly lower than those observed in other marine food webs. Of the 147 nodes, 34 are harvested. Links to harvested nodes represented 50 to 100\% of all trophic links of non-harvested nodes, illustrating the great impact that fishery pressure can have on the food web. The food web was compartmentalized into 5 sub-webs with high representation of harvested taxa. This structure changes if the fishery node is removed. Similarity analyses identified groups of harvested species with non-harvested nodes, suggesting that these tropho-equivalents could be sentinel species for the community-wide impacts of coastal fisheries. We conclude that fishing effects can be transmitted throughout the food web, with no compartments completely unaffected by harvesting. It is urgent to establish monitoring programs for community-wide effects of fisheries and assess whether resilience of these highly productive subtidal food webs has already been compromised, thereby identifying essential nodes that require stronger fisheries regulation.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Understanding which species might become extinct and the consequences of such loss is critical. One consequence is a cascade of further, secondary extinctions. While a significant amount is known about the types of communities and species that suffer secondary extinctions, little is known about the consequences of secondary extinctions for biodiversity. Here we examine the effect of these secondary extinctions on trophic diversity, the range of trophic roles played by the species in a community. Our analyses of natural and model food webs show that secondary extinctions cause loss of trophic diversity greater than that expected from chance, a result that is robust to variation in food web structure, distribution of interactions strengths, functional response, and adaptive foraging. Greater than expected loss of trophic diversity occurs because more trophically unique species are more vulnerable to secondary extinction. This is not a straightforward consequence of these species having few links with others but is a complex function of how direct and indirect interactions affect species persistence. A positive correlation between a species? extinction probability and the importance of its loss defines high?risk species and should make their conservation a priority.},

The intensive exploitation of fish communities often leads to substantial reductions in the abundance of target species, with ramifications for the structure and stability of the ecosystem as a whole. 2. We explored changes in the mean trophic level of the Celtic Sea (ICES divisions VII f-j) fish community using commercial landings, survey data and estimates of trophic level derived from the analysis of nitrogen stable isotopes. 3. Our analyses showed that there has been a significant decline in the mean trophic level of survey catches from 1982 to 2000 and a decline in the trophic level of landings from 1946 to 1998. 4. The decline in mean trophic level through time resulted from a reduction in the abundance of large piscivorous fishes and an increase in smaller pelagic species which feed at a lower trophic level. 5. Similar patterns of decline in the trophic level of both catches and landings imply that there have been substantial changes in the underlying structure of the Celtic Sea fish community and not simply a change in fishery preferences. 6. We suggest that the reported changes in trophic structure result from reductions in the spawning stock biomass of traditional target species associated with intensive fishing, together with long-term climate variability. 7. The relative distribution of fish market prices has changed significantly over the past 22 years, with high trophic level species experiencing greater price rises than lower trophic level species. 8. Although decreased abundance of high trophic level species will ultimately have negative economic consequences, the reduction in mean trophic level of the fish community as a whole may allow the system to sustain higher fishery yields. 9. Management objectives in this fishery will depend on the relative values that society attaches to economic profit and protein production.}

Artisanal and recreational fishing were permitted in the Gulf. To assess the effect of the ban on the abundance of demersal resources, CPUE from experimental trawl surveys carried out before the ban (spring 1987 and 1989) and 4 years after it was in place (spring 1994) were compared. Sampling design was based on three depth strata (10–50, 51–100, 101–200m); 21 and 30 hauls were made before and after the ban, respectively. Eleven target species (9 finfish and 2 cephalopods) as well as the total catch were used for comparisons. The total catch underwent an 8-fold increase in biomass after the four-year ban, and all the considered species underwent an increase, ranging from 1.2-fold for musky octopus (Eledone moschata) to 497-fold for gurnard (Lepidotrigla cavillone). The only decrease was for horned octopus (Eledone cirrhosa). A management strategy based on year-round trawling bans may prove useful, especially in areas where multispecies and multigear artisanal fisheries make up a large part of the fishing industry. The promising results obtained in the Gulf indicate an approach which might be practicable in areas where pre-existing data useful for traditional assessment and management are poor, or totally lacking, and where resources are already at risk of overexploitation.},

  abstract = {Do large organisms occupy higher trophic levels? Predators are often larger than their prey in food chains, but empirical evidence for positive body mass–trophic level scaling for entire food webs mostly comes from marine communities on the basis of unicellular producers. Using published data on stable isotope compositions of 1,093 consumer species, we explored how trophic level scales with body size, food web type (green vs. brown), and phylogenetic group across biomes. In contrast to widespread assumptions, the relationship between body size and trophic level of consumers—from protists to large vertebrates—was not significant per se but varied among ecosystem types and animal groups. The correlation between body size and trophic level was strong in marine consumers, weak in freshwater consumers, and absent in terrestrial consumers, which was also observed at the scale of local food webs. Vertebrates occupied higher trophic positions than invertebrates, and green trophic chains were longer than brown ones in aquatic (primarily marine) but not in terrestrial food webs. Variations in body size of top predators suggest that terrestrial and many freshwater food webs are size compartmentalized, implying different trophic dynamics and responses to perturbations than in size-structured marine food webs.},

To analyse local scale impacts of bottom trawling on food web structure we combined biological (species abundance and diets obtained from scientific bottom trawl surveys) and anthropogenic pressure (fishing effort obtained from Vessel Monitoring Systems, VMS) data. Using generalised additive models we explored the effect of bottom-trawling in nine community and trophic indicators across a gradient of fishing effort. We found an extensive effect of fishing on community indicators: with increasing fishing pressure, the biomass of seven out of fifteen functional groups declined, as well as that of the whole benthic-demersal community. Species richness was also significantly affected by bottom trawling, both at community and trophic level. We also showed a negative relationship between fishing effort and mean Trophic Level (mTL) of benthic and demersal communities at small-scale spatial resolution. Despite the apparent reduction of fishing effort observed in the study area in the last decade, we found a strong local influence of this anthropogenic pressure on the benthic-demersal food webs, demonstrating that small spatial resolution is crucial when investigating the effects of spatially heterogeneous pressures, such as fishing. Thus, we highlight the importance of analysing the effect of fishing on ecological indicators and trophic structure at local scales.},

However, delaying conservation action to collect further data and so reduce such uncertainty is often either impractical or inadvisable. 2.?The Macquarie Island Pest Eradication Project, currently underway, is attempting to eradicate rabbits, rats, and mice from the island. We undertook qualitative modelling of this project, examining a range of likely outcomes and their possible ecological consequences. The results were aggregated across a large number of possible models, in order to account for uncertainty concerning interactions within the ecosystem. 3.?The results strongly support the current actions of simultaneous eradication of all three pest species, as simulated eradications of only one or two generally led to continued impacts on the island?s native biota. The results also provided support for the anticipated positive outcomes of the project, with predicted recoveries of tall tussock vegetation, and burrow- and surface-nesting seabirds. 4.?However, the model predictions also highlighted potential risks: the eradication of mice from the island may not succeed, due in part to the structural position of this species within the ecosystem. Successful eradication of all three target species could potentially release the self-introduced, non-native redpolls and starlings, allowing expansion of their populations, with possible impacts on macro-invertebrates and vegetation. 5.?Synthesis and applications. These results demonstrate that qualitative modelling approaches can in some cases deliver consistent results, despite high levels of uncertainty regarding interactions within the underlying ecosystem. Such outcomes can provide assistance in the development of strategic contingency plans and ongoing future management action.},

For the first time, the authors of this study implemented a trait-based approach in the Argentine Patagonian Sea to identify the vulnerability and spatiotemporal changes in functional diversity of fish assemblages incidentally captured by a trawling fleet targeting the Argentine red shrimp Pleoticus muelleri (Spence Bate, 1888) between 2003 and 2014. The authors coupled seven fish trophic traits to a reconstructed fish assemblage for the study area and by-catch and evaluated changes in fish species richness and four complementary functional diversity measures (functional richness, redundancy, dispersion and community trait values) along with fishing intensity, temporal use, latitudinal location and depth of fishing grounds, and vessel length. Resident fishes larger than 30 cm in length, with depressed and fusiform bodies, intermediate to high trophic levels, and feeding in benthic, demersal and midwater areas were vulnerable to by-catch. In addition, fish assemblages exhibited a low functional trait redundancy, likely related to species influxes in a biogeographic ecotone with tropicalisation signs. Significant increases in fish trait richness and dispersion poleward and deep suggested new functional roles in these grounds, matching trends in community body size, reproductive load, maximum depth and trophic level. Finally, a temporal increase in fish species and functional trait removal in fishing grounds led to trait homogenisation since 2003. The authors identified that tipping points in temperate fish functional trait diversity showed the importance of trait-based approaches within ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

In this model, predation is determined by predator and prey size and abundance, and drives predator growth and prey mortality. Fishing amplifies temporal oscillations in the biomass flow. Oscillations appear at lower fishing intensity and have wider amplitude when fishing is selective (removes a narrow size range) and/or when large fish are targeted, than when fishing is more balanced (catching a larger size range) or when small fish are targeted. A novel index of size diversity is developed, and is shown to be sensitive to both fishing intensity and selectivity. To avoid unstable food web dynamics with potential harmful consequences for fisheries, limiting both fishing intensity and selectivity might be an appropriate exploitation strategy.}

The patterning consisted of the simultaneous occurrence of strong "top down" effects at lower trophic levels and strong "bottom up" effects at higher trophic levels.

Stomach contents from 28 demersal fish species were analyzed. Taxonomic and trophic spectrum were obtained. Using weight percentage of each prey, trophic spectrum variations for size classes were analized for each of the 12 considered "dominant" species. Overlaping in the diet among these predators was estimate using cluster analysis. There was an interespecific diet overlap between juveniles belonging to demersal-benthic fish species, because all of them prey upon Stomatopoda and Munida. Adults from those species and hake prefered young and adult hake as preys, while Macruronus magellanicus and juvelines Merluccius hubbsi ate mainly zooplankton. In addition, there were son seasonal changes in prey species preferences, but food habits changed considerably with fish size.},

  abstract = {1. Local food webs result from a sequence of colonisations and extinctions by species from the regional pool or metaweb, i.e., the assembly process. Assembly is theorised to be a selective process: whether or not certain species or network structures can persist is partly determined by local processes including habitat filtering and dynamical constraints. Consequently, local food web structure should reflect these processes. 2. The goal of this study was to test evidence for these selective processes by comparing the structural properties of real food webs to the expected distribution given the metaweb. We were particularly interested in ecological dynamics; if the network properties commonly associated with dynamical stability are indeed the result of stability constraints, then they should deviate from expectation in the direction predicted by theory. 3. To create a null expectation, we used the novel approach of randomly assembling model webs by drawing species and interactions from the empirical metaweb. The assembly model permitted colonisation and extinction, and required a consumer species to have at least one prey, but had no habitat type nor population dynamical constraints. Three data sets were used: (1) the marine Antarctic metaweb, with 2 local food-webs; (2) the 50 lakes of the Adirondacks; and (3) the arthropod community from Florida Keys’ classic defaunation experiment. 4. Contrary to our expectations, we found that there were almost no differences between empirical webs and those resulting from the null assembly model. Few empirical food webs showed significant differences with network properties, motif representations and topological roles. Network properties associated with stability did not deviate from expectation in the direction predicted by theory. 5. Our results suggest that — for the commonly used metrics we considered — local food web structure is not strongly influenced by dynamical nor habitat restrictions. Instead, the structure is inherited from the metaweb. This suggests that the network properties typically attributed as causes or consequences of ecological stability are instead a by-product of the assembly process (i.e., spandrels), and may potentially be too coarse to detect the true signal of dynamical constraint.},

  abstract = {Two k-sample versions of an Anderson–Darling rank statistic are proposed for testing the homogeneity of samples. Their asymptotic null distributions are derived for the continuous as well as the discrete case. In the continuous case the asymptotic distributions coincide with the (k – 1)-fold convolution of the asymptotic distribution for the Anderson–Darling one-sample statistic. The quality of this large sample approximation is investigated for small samples through Monte Carlo simulation. This is done for both versions of the statistic under various degrees of data rounding and sample size imbalances. Tables for carrying out these tests are provided, and their usage in combining independent one- or k-sample Anderson–Darling tests is pointed out. The test statistics are essentially based on a doubly weighted sum of integrated squared differences between the empirical distribution functions of the individual samples and that of the pooled sample. One weighting adjusts for the possibly different sample sizes, and the other is inside the integration placing more weight on tail differences of the compared distributions. The two versions differ mainly in the definition of the empirical distribution function. These tests are consistent against all alternatives. The use of these tests is two-fold: (a) in a one-way analysis of variance to establish differences in the sampled populations without making any restrictive parametric assumptions or (b) to justify the pooling of separate samples for increased sample size and power in further analyses. Exact finite sample mean and variance formulas for one of the two statistics are derived in the continuous case. It appears that the asymptotic standardized percentiles serve well as approximate critical points of the appropriately standardized statistics for individual sample sizes as low as 5. The application of the tests is illustrated with an example. Because of the convolution nature of the asymptotic distribution, a further use of these critical points is possible in combining independent Anderson–Darling tests by simply adding their test statistics.},

  abstract = {Rich ecosystems harbour thousands of species interacting in tangled networks encompassing predation, mutualism and competition. Such widespread biodiversity is puzzling, because in ecological models it is exceedingly improbable for large communities to stably coexist. One aspect rarely considered in these models, however, is that coexisting species in natural communities are a selected portion of a much larger pool, which has been pruned by population dynamics. Here we compute the distribution of the number of species that can coexist when we start from a pool of species interacting randomly, and show that even in this case we can observe rich, stable communities. Interestingly, our results show that, once stability conditions are met, network structure has very little influence on the level of biodiversity attained. Our results identify the main drivers responsible for widespread coexistence in natural communities, providing a baseline for determining which structural aspects of empirical communities promote or hinder coexistence.},

Scavenging on trawled seabeds can modify trophic size structure of bottom-dwelling fish. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 71: 398–405.Disturbance by towed bottom-fishing gears often kills larger sensitive benthos, leading to changes in the abundance, size, and species composition of benthic communities. Short-term availability of trawl-damaged prey, and longer-term shifts in benthic prey community composition, both have the potential to affect feeding opportunities and realized dietary preferences of bottom-feeding (benthivorous) fish. To investigate these effects of bottom-fishing activity (by otter trawls, beam trawls, and dredges) on the feeding of benthivorous fish, we compared the trophic level at body size and diets of four species in areas of the Celtic Sea subject to low, intermediate, and high fishing activity. Trophic level was estimated using nitrogen stable isotope analysis, and fishing activity was quantified with vessel monitoring system (VMS) data. For whiting (Merlangius merlangus) of all sizes, trophic level was slightly lower in areas of higher fishing activity. After accounting for the results of the diet analysis, we concluded that this reflected increased scavenging of benthic invertebrates in more intensively fished areas. For megrim (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis), the rate of increase in trophic level with size was lower with increasing fishing activity, implying that megrim may also substitute fish with lower-trophic invertebrates that can be scavenged in more intensively fished areas. For plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and lemon sole (Microstomus kitt), no significant effects of fishing activity on trophic level were detected. We conclude that differences in the intensity of fishing activity with towed bottom gears had small but variable effects of the trophic size structure of the four species, and that this primarily reflected scavenging rather than diet changes following longer-term shifts in composition of the prey community.},

Although the dynamic implications of compartmentalization have been debated for at least four decades, a general answer has remained elusive. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate that compartmentalization acts to increase the persistence of multitrophic food webs. We then identify the mechanisms behind this result. Compartments in food webs act directly to buffer the propagation of extinctions throughout the community and augment the long-term persistence of its constituent species. This contribution to persistence is greater the more complex the food web, which helps to reconcile the simultaneous complexity and stability of natural communities.},

Here we introduce the ‘Curveball algorithm’, a new procedure that differs from existing methods in that it focuses rather on matrix information content than on matrix structure. We demonstrate that the algorithm can sample uniformly the set of all possible matrix configurations requiring a computational effort orders of magnitude lower than that required by available methods, making it possible to easily randomize matrices larger than 108 cells.},

  abstract = {Human involvement in food webs has been profound, bringing about enormous and disproportionate losses of large apex predators on land and in water. The losses have modified or even eliminated concatenations of indirect interactions propagating from predators to herbivores to plants, inter alia. Food webs are a synthesis of bottom-up energy and nutrient flow from plant producers to consumers and top-down regulation of producers by consumers. The trophic cascade is the simplest top-down interaction and accounts for a great deal of what is known about food webs. In three-link cascades, predators suppress herbivores, releasing plants. In longer cascades, predators can suppress smaller mesopredators, releasing their prey animals. Hunting, fishing, and whaling have brought parallel losses of large apex predators to food webs. Without apex predators, smaller mesopredators have often become superabundant, sometimes with unprecedented suppression of their prey, extinctions, and endangerment. Flourishing mesopredators also can reverse the web regulation and suppress apex predators that have become rare owing to hunting and fishing. This can prevent fisheries recovery and lead to persistent alternative ecosystem states. Although food-web modules of large animals are increasingly well understood, the parts of webs consisting of small inconspicuous organisms, such as mutualists and parasites, and webs in obscure places, such as in the soil, are much of the challenge of future research.}

The results show that the stock density of fishery resources declined in the gulf from 1961 to 2017. The composition of dominant species in trawl surveys from Beibu Gulf changed greatly from 1961–1962 to 2016–2017 and showed a shift from bottom species to pelagic species and from high-trophic-level species to low-trophic-level species. Catches of low-trophic-level species increased, while the dominance of high-trophic-level species declined. The mean trophic level of fish from the gulf declined from 3.90 in 1961–1962 to 3.45 in 1998–1999 at a rate of 0.13 of a trophic level per decade and then began to increase to 3.65 in 2016–2017 at a rate of 0.12 of a trophic level per decade. The fishing-in-balance index dropped to –0.96 in 1998–1999 and then slightly increased. The results indicate that fisheries resources in the Beibu Gulf have been overfished.

General lack of data and uncertainty about the level of employment in marine fisheries can lead to underestimation of fishing effort and hence over-exploited fisheries, or result in inaccurate projections of economic and societal costs and benefits. To address this gap, a database of marine fisheries employment for 144 coastal nations was compiled. Gaps in employment data that emerged were filled using a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the number of direct and indirect fisheries jobs. We focused on estimating jobs in the small-scale fishing sector. We characterized small-scale fishing as (i) primarily geared towards household consumption or sale at the local level; (ii) conducted at a low level of economic activity; (iii) minimally mechanized; (iv) conducted within inshore areas; (v) minimally managed; and/or (vi) undertaken for cultural or ceremonial purposes. In total, we estimated that 260 ± 6 million people are involved in global marine fisheries, encompassing full-time and part-time jobs in the direct and indirect sectors, with 22 ± 0.45 million of those being small-scale fishers. This is equivalent to 203 ± 34 million full-time equivalent jobs. Study results can be used to improve management decision making and highlight the need to improve monitoring and reporting of the number of people employed in marine fisheries globally.},

  abstract = {Este trabajo analiza la circulación oceánica en los Golfos Norpatagónicos, una región del Mar Argentino que es ampliamente reconocida por la alta tasa de productividad y biodiversidad del ecosistema. El estudio está orientado  fundamentalmente a una exploración sistemática de los procesos físicos que controlan la circulación mediante el empleo de un modelo numérico tridimensional de alta resolución. El análisis físico del problema progresa mediante una sucesión de experimentos numéricos de complejidad creciente, comienza con el estudio de un modelo de densidad constante (barotrópico) forzado por mareas y vientos y  finaliza con el caso más complejo que incluye estratificación en la columna de agua generada por flujos de calor y humedad en la superficie. El resultado más importante que surge de este trabajo es que el forzante de mareas contribuye  significativamente a la circulación residual en escalas submareales, tanto en el modelo homogéneo como en el estratificado. Los resultados del modelo homogéneo muestran que la interacción no-lineal entre la onda de marea y la topografía de fondo conduce a la formación de diversos patrones robustos de circulación residual: giros de cuenca, vórtices batimétricos y cuadupolos costeros, formados por vórtices de recirculación en las bocas del GSJ y GN. Con la excepción de los meses de invierno, cuando los vientos son más intensos, la respuesta del océano barotrópico está completamente dominada por la circulación ciclónica residual inducida por la marea. Se requiere un viento de gran intensidad y dirección adecuada (p.e. desde el Norte) para romper este patrón. Los resultados del modelo estratificado también muestran la profunda influencia de la marea en modelar el ciclo anual de circulación dentro del Golfo San Matías. La circulación general está dominada por un intenso  giro ciclónico (compuesto de dos giros de recirculación) durante el verano y giros menores anticiclónicos en la costa sudoeste y al Norte de Península Valdés. El incremento de la circulación ciclónica entre Octubre y Febrero es producido por la interacción de la marea con la estratificación (generada por los flujos de calor) en la presencia de topografía variable. Como resultado de esta circulación cerrada, en verano el Golfo se halla prácticamente aislado de la plataforma externa. De Marzo a Setiembre con la erosión de la estratificación, el subgiro norte decae y gradualmente reduce su tamaño hasta ser absorbido por el subgiro sur. Simultáneamente el sector  Oeste del Golfo es ocupado por un giro anticilónico. La inclusión del forzante de viento no modifica sustancialmente la estructura e intensidad del los giros de verano pero intensifica tanto los giros anticiclónicos como ciclónicos durante el otoñoinvierno.

  abstract = {Overexploitation of marine communities can lead to modifications in the structure of the food web and can force organisms like elasmobranchs to change their feeding habits. To evaluate the impact that fisheries have on food webs and on the interactions between species, it is necessary to describe and quantify the diet of the species involved and follow it through time. This study compares the diet of five skate species using the data obtained from the by-catch of the Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi) fishery in north and central Patagonia, Argentina. Diet composition was assessed by analysing the digestive tract contents and trophic overlapping between species of the genus Bathyraja: Bathyraja albomaculata, Bathyraja brachyurops, Bathyraja macloviana, Bathyraja magellanica and Bathyraja multispinis. A total of 184 stomachs were analysed. The diets of B. albomaculata and B. macloviana mainly comprised annelids, whereas that of B. brachyurops primarily comprised fish, including hake heads discarded by the fishery. The diets of B. magellanica and B. multispinis were largely based on crustaceans. Despite the morphological similarities and their shared preference for benthic habitats, no complete diet overlaps were found between the different species. These results suggest that these skate species have undergone a process of diet specialisation. This is a common feeding strategy that occurs to successfully eliminate competition when resources are limited, which corresponds to the conditions found in an environment being affected by the pressures of overfishing.},

  abstract = {Abstract In the domain of decision-support tools for the management of marine fish resources, considerable attention has been paid to the development of models explaining how fish stocks change over space and time. In most models, fishing effort is assumed to be exogenous and determined by factors such as management. Increasingly, there has been a call for bio-economic models to also account for the dynamics of fishing fleets, recognizing that fishers respond to changing environmental, institutional and economic conditions. A growing literature has sought to explicitly model the endogenous determinants of the capacity of fishing fleets, the intensity of its use and its temporal and spatial allocation across fishing opportunities. We review this literature, focusing on empirical applications of the behavioural models that have been put forward to explain and predict observed fleet dynamics. We find that although economic factors are usually included as a dominant driver in most studies, this is often based on the use of proxy variables for the key economic drivers, for which adequate data are lacking. Also, while many studies acknowledge that social and social?psychological factors play a significant role in explaining observed fishing behaviour, their inclusion in fishing fleet dynamic models is still very limited. Progress in this domain can only be achieved via the development of multidisciplinary research programmes focusing on applied quantitative analysis of the drivers of fishing fleet dynamics.},

Considering species-specifi c catch data as the common minimum available data for assessing the status of a stock, in this paper we use the taxonomic breakdown of the reported landings statistics to FAO to make an approximate inference of data limitation of fi sheries by region, country, and taxonomic groups. The paper also explores the possibility of extracting meaningful biological information from fi sheries landings by applying a Bayesian approach to two selected fi sheries. The contribution of data-poor fi sheries to the world landings from marine capture fi sheries is relatively low, but increasing (from 20 to 30\% of world landings in the last 50 years). However, data limitation can be a substantial problem at the regional and country level, especially in areas with high species diversity, small stock sizes, and where fi sheries play an important role for food security. Preliminary modeling results indicate that catch data, when combined with prior information about the dynamics of similar species/stocks and fi sheries, could be useful for informing fi sheries management in data-limited situations.},

Early mechanism-based theory asserted that food webs have little omnivory and several properties that are independent of species richness1,2,3,4,6. This theory was overturned by empirical studies that found food webs to be much more complex5,7,8,9,14,15,16,17,18, but these studies did not provide mechanistic explanations for the complexity9. Here we show that a remarkably simple model fills this scientific void by successfully predicting key structural properties of the most complex and comprehensive food webs in the primary literature. These properties include the fractions of species at top, intermediate and basal trophic levels, the means and variabilities of generality, vulnerability and food-chain length, and the degrees of cannibalism, omnivory, looping and trophic similarity. Using only two empirical parameters, species number and connectance, our ‘niche model’ extends the existing ‘cascade model’3,19 and improves its fit ten-fold by constraining species to consume a contiguous sequence of prey in a one-dimensional trophic niche20.},

  abstract = {Omnivory, feeding at more than one trophic level, is a prevalent feature of freshwater ecosystems. Understanding where and when omnivory is important, its relevance for sustaining diversity, and the effect it may have on ecosystem responses to disturbances, are necessary for effective management of freshwater ecosystems. The many theoretical predictions of the effects of omnivory are often contradictory, and empirical studies aimed at understanding omnivory have been difficult and contingent on a number of factors. Here, I synthesise theoretical evidence to generate five predictions of where omnivory will be most important in freshwater ecosystems, how it is maintained and the effect it will have on communities. First, theory indicates that, while strong omnivorous interactions are destabilising, weak omnivorous interactions usually enhance stability. Therefore, mechanisms which decrease the strength of omnivorous interactions should favour their occurrence and increase stability of food webs. Secondly, omnivorous interactions which are theoretically unstable may be found in stable food webs due to stabilising features of the web as a whole. Thirdly, omnivory is likely to persist primarily at intermediate productivity levels and be more common in disturbed environments. Fourthly, omnivory is likely to decrease the strength of trophic cascades. Finally, omnivores should generally make more successful invaders. These predictions are important for effective freshwater management because actions which decrease the strength of omnivorous interactions, such as maintaining habitat refuges for consumers (e.g. woody debris and aquatic plants), may be essential for sustaining biodiversity. In addition, if omnivores make better invaders, effective invasion management may benefit from focussing resources on omnivorous invaders to limit their spread and impact. Overall, this synthesis of theoretical and empirical studies indicates that, while their predictions may be frequently at odds, with deeper investigation they are largely reconcilable and can be used to make practical suggestions for the careful management of omnivory in freshwater food webs.},

  abstract = {Random environmental variation, or stochasticity, is a key determinant of ecological dynamics. While we have some appreciation of how environmental stochasticity can moderate the variability and persistence of communities, we know little about its implications for the nature and predictability of ecological responses to large perturbations. Here, we show that shifts in the temporal autocorrelation (colour) of environmental noise provoke trade-offs in ecological stability across a wide range of different food-web structures by stabilizing dynamics in some dimensions, while simultaneously destabilizing them in others. Specifically, increasingly positive autocorrelation (reddening) of environmental noise increases resilience by hastening the recovery of food webs following a large perturbation, but reduces their resistance to perturbation and increases their temporal variability (reduces biomass stability). In contrast, all stability dimensions become less predictable, showing increased variability around the mean response, as environmental noise reddens. Moreover, we found environmental reddening to be a considerably more important determinant of stability than intrinsic food-web characteristics. These findings reveal the fundamental and dominant role played by environmental stochasticity in determining the dynamics and stability of ecosystems, and extend our understanding of how the multiple dimensions of stability relate to each other beyond simple white noise environments.},

The paper discusses how an EAF can be adopted for data limited fisheries and uses the northern South China Sea fishery as an example to demonstrate the selection and use of indicators for determining the states of the fishery and its relevant ecosystem to provide advice on management. Implementing EAF management requires indicators and models that address the impact of fishing across entire ecological communities and determine management actions to be taken to achieve the preset objectives according to decision rules. Data limited fisheries necessarily have limited resources for data collection and scientific studies and therefore could not support complex models. To overcome the data limitation and absence of modelling support, simple indicators have to be used to assess the current state and monitor changes of the fishery and its ecosystem. Such indicators should: (1) be observable and understandable by all stakeholders, (2) be based on easily obtainable and reliable data, (3) adequately reflect the condition of the resource, and (4) have associated reference values and responsive management measures. The paper also reviews the recent development and use of indicators and harvest strategies in both conventional and EAF management to better understand the differences and to shed light on the challenges of EAF, in particular for data limited fisheries.},

However, there is very little evidence that this is a realistic viewpoint. To test this fundamental assumption ‘empirically’, I have constructed here plausible community matrices1,2 corresponding to 40 real food webs3 and studied their local stability properties. I find that stability (in the sense of tending to return to the presumed equilibrium after a small perturbation) is far more likely if the interaction strengths are chosen in accord with the nature of the particular organisms in each food web, rather than strictly at random. Either this is a monumental coincidence, or the equilibrium viewpoint really is appropriate for quite a few real communities. Additional results of this analysis are that stability generally requires a degree of intraspecific interference on the part of some consumer species, whereas interspecific interference tends to exert a destabilizing influence.},

Seabirds are wide ranging, often crossing jurisdictional boundaries during foraging. Using a recently designated MPA as a case study, this article discusses the challenges of protecting breeding seabirds given their spatial requirements and use of different jurisdictions. Seabirds breeding at the MPA have distinct foraging strategies. Rock Shags and Olrog's Gulls forage inshore within the MPA. Imperial Cormorants, Magellanic Penguins, and Southern Giant Petrels, in contrast, often feed beyond the MPA's jurisdiction, traveling into provincial, federal, or international waters where they can be affected by fisheries and oil development. This indicates the need of management actions beyond MPA boundaries. The large scale and connectivity of marine ecosystems and the variety of economic pressures require the participation of stakeholders and several government agencies in conservation issues, and thus integrated coastal management and marine spatial planning appear as options to complement the use of MPAs. Although MPAs are a valuable tool to conserve breeding seabirds, increased efforts are needed to design new governance structures and complementary strategies for spatial protection so as to deal with the biological, social, and political complexities of marine systems.},

Additionally, wide-scale monitoring is needed to adequately interpret demographic behaviour given the metapopulation dynamics characteristics of most seabird species and to understand the underlying factors, such as anthropogenic pressures and climate change. Many cormorant species are largely dependent on coastal marine environments, which are subject to increasing pressures from human activities. Here, we update information on the distribution and size of Imperial Cormorant (Leucocarbo atriceps) colonies along 1,000 km of coastline in Argentina, and review published information to assess population trends at different spatial scales over 26 years (1990–2016). During 2016, the number of nests per colony ranged between 2 and 5,617 (median: 441 nests; n = 26). Total number of breeding pairs was estimated at 21,482. During the study period, two new locations were colonised, whilst another two were abandoned. Significant growth rates ranged from 1.022 to 1.117 (median: 1.036; n = 6) for increasing colonies and from 0.580 to 0.977 (median: 0.962; n = 8) for declining colonies, but the overall breeding population remained stable between 1990 and 2016 (λ = 1.000, C.I. 95\% = 0.991–1.008). Our study provides one of the longest time series on seabird breeding numbers along a wide coastal sector in South America. Given the high yearly variability in nest numbers at individual Imperial Cormorant colonies, as well as the observed establishment and extinction of colonies, large scale and long term monitoring is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of overall changes in the population distribution patterns.},

  abstract = {Food webs capture the trophic relationships and energy fluxes between species, which has fundamental impacts on ecosystem functioning and stability. Within a food web, the energy flux distribution between a predator and its prey species is shaped by food quantity–quality trade-offs and the contiguity of foraging. But the distribution of energy fluxes among prey species as well as its drivers and implications remain unclear. Here we used 157 aquatic food webs, which contain explicit energy flux information, to examine whether a predator's foraging is asymmetric and biased towards lower or higher trophic levels, and how these patterns may change with trophic level. We also evaluate how traditional topology-based approaches may over- or under-estimate a predator's trophic level and omnivory by ignoring the asymmetric foraging patterns. Our results demonstrated the prevalence of asymmetric foraging in natural aquatic food webs. Although predators prefer prey at higher trophic levels with potentially higher food quality, they obtain their energy mostly from lower trophic levels with a higher food quantity. Both tendencies, that is, stronger feeding preference for prey at higher trophic levels and stronger energetic reliance on prey at lower trophic levels are alleviated for predators at higher trophic levels. The asymmetric foraging lowers trophic levels and omnivory at both species and food web levels, compared to estimates from traditional topology-based approaches. Such overestimations by topology-based approaches are most pronounced for predators at lower trophic levels and communities with higher number of trophic species. Our study highlights the importance of energy flux information in understanding the foraging behaviour of predators as well as the structural complexity of natural food webs. The increasing availability of flux-based food web data will thus provide new opportunities to reconcile food web structure, functioning and stability.},

  abstract = {Globally, many fish species are overexploited, and many stocks have collapsed. This crisis, along with increasing concerns over flow-on effects on ecosystems, has caused a reevaluation of traditional fisheries management practices, and a new ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) paradigm has emerged. As part of this approach, selective fishing is widely encouraged in the belief that nonselective fishing has many adverse impacts. In particular, incidental bycatch is seen as wasteful and a negative feature of fishing, and methods to reduce bycatch are implemented in many fisheries. However, recent advances in fishery science and ecology suggest that a selective approach may also result in undesirable impacts both to fisheries and marine ecosystems. Selective fishing applies one or more of the “6-S” selections: species, stock, size, sex, season, and space. However, selective fishing alters biodiversity, which in turn changes ecosystem functioning and may affect fisheries production, hindering rather than helping achieve the goals of EBFM. We argue here that a “balanced exploitation” approach might alleviate many of the ecological effects of fishing by avoiding intensive removal of particular components of the ecosystem, while still supporting sustainable fisheries. This concept may require reducing exploitation rates on certain target species or groups to protect vulnerable components of the ecosystem. Benefits to society could be maintained or even increased because a greater proportion of the entire suite of harvested species is used.},
