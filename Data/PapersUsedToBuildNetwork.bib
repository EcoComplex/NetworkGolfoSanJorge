  abstract = {White-headed Steamer-Ducks (Tachyeres leucocephalus) are flightless waterfowl endemic to a small section of coastline in Patagonia, Argentina. This study provides the first detailed information on White-headed Steamer-Duck diet composition, foraging behavior and prey availability. This study was conducted in the northern San Jorge Gulf, Patagonia, during 2007. Fifteen feeding territories were identified, and food availability was quantified within them and also within unused areas. A total of 45 feces were analyzed to determine diet composition, and foraging behaviors of females were monitored. Benthic community diversity differed between territories and non-territories. Overall, diversity and invertebrate abundance tended to be higher in territories. Ten invertebrate prey taxa were identified in adult diets, and the most frequent prey in feces were crabs, mussels, and ragworms. Head-neck dipping was the most common method of feeding. Our results improve the understanding of the relationship between diet, selection of areas with special invertebrate availability and foraging techniques used to access and exploit the resources.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of sex, maturity stage, and body size on the diet of the Magellan skate, Bathyraja magellanica, in the Southwest Atlantic off Argentina, by examining stomach contents using a multiple hypothesis modeling approach. Relationships between the number of prey and sex, maturity stage, and total length (TL) were assessed by built generalized linear models (GLM). Furthermore, we tested whether there was a threshold size at which B. magellanica started or quit consuming a given prey. The overall diet of B. magellanica was mainly consisted of teleosts, followed by amphipods, isopods, and decapods. Ontogenetic diet shifts were independent of sex and maturity stage. However, discrete shifts in diet with TL were found, with individuals larger than 554 and 623~mm TL ceasing to consume amphipods and isopods, respectively. The consumption of teleosts progressively increased with increasing predator size. Likewise, ontogenetic shifts in foraging behavior were also observed with smaller individuals showing specialization on amphipods with larger specimens consuming teleosts. These results confirm that ontogenetic shifts in diet of B. magellanica are more a function of predator size rather than any other life-history traits. We propose that these food shifts are probably related to morphological limitations and abilities associated with feeding habits of skate, so when specimens of B.~magellanica reach an optimum body size, they may have access to higher quality trophic resources. Our results suggest that evaluating the importance of life-history stages on the feeding habits of a species is essential for understanding how that species exploits food resources, which, in turn, is an important factor in developing a suitable plan of marine ecosystem conservation.},

Identifying the main correlates of the feeding habits of skates is of paramount importance for determining their ecological role. We tested the hypotheses that the diet of the spotback skate, Atlantoraja castelnaui, off Uruguay and northern Argentina, changes with increasing body size, between seasons and regions and that prey size increased with predator's size using a multiple-hypothesis modelling approach. A. castelnaui preyed mainly on teleosts, followed by cephalopods, elasmobranchs and decapods. Small individuals of A. castelnaui consumed decapods and large individuals ate elasmobranchs and cephalopods. The consumption of teleosts was constant along the ontogeny but differed between seasons; more demersal-benthic teleosts were consumed in the cold season, whereas more benthic teleosts were eaten in the warm season. Also, A. castelnaui consumed more cephalopods in the warm season than in the cold season. Benthic teleosts were consumed more in the south region, whereas decapods were eaten more in the north region. A. castelnaui is able to consume larger teleosts as it grows. We conclude that A. castelnaui is a versatile, mainly piscivorous, consumer that shifts its diet with increasing body size and in response to seasonal and regional changes in prey abundance or distribution.},

The feeding habits of this species, from off Uruguay and north Argentina, were evaluated using a multiple hypothesis modelling approach. In general, the diet was composed mainly of decapod crustaceans, followed by teleost fishes. Molluscs, mysidaceans, amphipods, isopods, lancelets and elasmobranchs were consumed in lower proportion. The consumption of shrimps drecreased with increasing body size of A. cyclophora. On the other hand, the consumption of teleosts increased with body size. Mature individuals preyed more heavily on crabs than immature individuals. Teleosts were consumed more in the south region (34\textordmasculine{} - 38\textordmasculine S) and crabs in the north region (38\textordmasculine{} - 41\textordmasculine S). Shrimps were eaten more in the warm season than in the cold season. Prey size increased with increasing body size of A. cyclophora , but large individuals also consumed small teleosts and crabs. Atlantoraja cyclophora has demersal-benthic feeding habits, shifts its diet with increasing body size and in response to seasonal and regional changes in prey availability and distribution.},

Generalized Linear Models were used to test the effects of Geographic location, Total Length, Sex and Maturity stage on the diet. The most commonly occurring major prey groups differed between Geographic locations. In R\'io de la Plata (RLP) deep M. schmitti feed on Crustaceans, Fish and Polychaetes, whereas Crustaceans, Polychaetes and Fishes were the main prey in RLP coast, Rinc\'on (RIN) coast and RIN deep, respectively. Moreover, models showed dietary shift related to total length in each Geographic location. In coastal nursery areas Polychaetes decreased and Fishes increased in importance as M. schmitti grew in size; while Crustaceans increased in importance from small to medium size, and then decreased in the large specimens. Deeper areas also show dietary changes related to growth. The trophic level of M. schmitti showed lower values in coastal Geographic locations (3.48\textendash 3.53) than in deeper Geographic locations (3.56\textendash 3.77). The higher trophic role in deeper communities could be related to the size of M. schmitti which increases with depth. Finally, total vacuity index was 2.47 (the lowest in the literature) indicating an intense and continuous feeding activity of the species.},

The trophic level of M. hubbsi ranged from 3.43 to 4.51 according to season and region.

From 776 specimens analysed, 671 (86{$\cdot$}5\%) ranging from 180 to 1190 mm total length (LT) had prey in their stomachs. The diet was dominated by fishes, mainly the notothenioid Patagonotothen ramsayi and the Argentine hake Merluccius hubbsi. The consumption of fishes and crabs increased with increasing predator size, and these preys were more important in the north than in the south. Isopods and other crustaceans were consumed more in the south and their consumption decreased as the size of Z. chilensis increased. The TL of Z. chilensis increased with LT from 4{$\cdot$}29 to 4{$\cdot$}59 (mean 4{$\cdot$}53), confirming their ecological role as a top predator. The small and large size classes exhibited a low diet overlap and the highest spatial segregation, whereas medium and large specimens had higher co-occurrence and dietary overlap indices. A clear distinction in tooth shape was noted between sexes in adult specimens, with males having longer cusps. This sexual heterodonty may be related to reproductive behaviour, increasing the grasping ability of males during courtship, because there were no differences in diet between the sexes.},

Ten research cruises were carried out each year during January from 2005 to 2014. A total of 18,461 specimens of Me. hubbsi was analysed, of which 6,777 (36.71\%) contained food in their stomachs.

The diet of white-chinned petrels was similar between years and consistent with previous studies. Krill Euphausia superba (41\textendash 42\% by weight) was the single most important prey item followed by fish (39\textendash 29\%) and squid (19\textendash 25\%). Meal mass was consistent (110 g in 1996, 119 g in 1998) between years but a significant decrease (46\%) in feeding frequency in 1998 (0.54 meals day-1 compared to 0.75 meals day-1 in 1996) resulted in 19\% less food delivered to chicks in 1998 than in 1996. Breeding success, however, was consistent between years at 44\% and similar to that recorded previously at Bird Island. This is in contrast to black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses, both of which experienced almost total breeding failure in 1998. It is suggested that their varied and versatile feeding methods, together with their greater diving ability, capacity to feed at night and extensive foraging range, help white-chinned petrels minimise the effects of krill shortage.},

The total number of burrows in each quadrat was consistent between each survey but we estimate an overall decrease of 28\% in those occupied (with considerable variation between sites). Concurrent data on breeding frequency and success showed that white-chinned petrels are essentially annual breeders at Bird Island; breeding success was consistent at around 44\%. Significant factors determining densities of occupied burrows were crown height and percent tussock cover (accounting for 77\% of variance). The former has decreased significantly, the latter increased significantly between 1981 and 1998 but there was no relationship between white-chinned petrel occupancy rate and habitat modification due to the presence of fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella). This suggests that any population decline is due to factors operating away from the breeding colony, such as those attributed to fishing.},

Stomach contents of P. maculata in two sampling sites located at Golfo Nuevo, Patagonia Argentina, revealed animals as a major prey, but surprisingly algae ingestion on both sampling sites was abundant. This fact was not reported in previous studies that described opportunistic carnivorous feeding habits of species belonging to the genus Pleurobranchaea. Significant differences in the species prey items were found between sampling sites; however, sedentary polychaetes were the main consumed group at both sites. These results are useful to understand the adaptation of this invasive species in Argentinean waters and to monitor future changes in the benthic communities colonised by P. maculata.},

The world market of the squid resources has considerably risen in the last decades and one of the most important fishery zones is placed in the Southwest Atlantic region (Area 41, FAO), where squid represent 25. of the total landings. Illex argentinus, sustains the second fishery in volume, with landings reaching 612.000 tonnes in 1999. Other species, such as Loligo sanpaulensis, Loligo gahi and Martialia hyadesi, are supporting small domestic fisheries. Also included is the current knowledge on Ommastrephes bartrami and Thysanoteuthis rhombus, cosmopolitan species that sustain important fisheries in other regions, and could be fishery exploitably alternatives here. A special case is that of Moroteuthis ingens, a worldwide particularly abundant species, but whose exploitation has been not developed yet. Finally, the giant squid (Architeuthis sp.)is included, as it started to appear frequently in this region during the last years and its knowledge is of high scientific value.},

Previous studies indicated that polychaetes constitute its main food. The contribution of different families of worms to the diet of hawkfish and the relationships between those taxa and the benthic fauna of the feeding grounds are presented in this paper. A total of 522 specimens of fish was measured, weighed and the gut contents analyzed. Polychaete families, mainly Onuphidae, Lumbrineridae and Eunicidae, were the most important feeding items in specimens from 28 to 51 cm total length, both in percent of frequence (\%F) and percent of weight (\%W). Occasional presence of Aphroditidae, Arabellidae, Palmyridae, Lysaretidae and Dorvilleidae was recorded. Bibliographic data on faunistic composition of feeding grounds indicate that polychaetes constitute between 12 to 21\% of number of taxa of macroinvertebrates. C. bergi feed upon 25\textendash 38\% of species of polychaetes present in the area. It is concluded that C. bergi feed on polychaetes which are mandibulated, implying mobility over the benthic surface.}

The stomach contents of 218 individuals were analyzed by occurrence and volumetric methods. O. bonariensis' diet is based on insects, scales, plants and detritus. Microcrustaceans (Cladocera and Copepoda) were the main items, allowing the characterization of the species as zooplanktivore. The species has a superior position and protractible mouth, with small teeth, creating a serrated pattern, uniformly lined side by side. There are many gill rakers, that are long and close together (typical of filtering fishes); the stomach is ill defined and the intestine is short. There was a gradual increase of O. bonariensis' abundance during the period of field study, mainly after the second year of damming. This fact seems to be closely related with the high abundance and availability of zooplankton in the dammed environment, and also with the ability of the species to exploit this resource.},

The stomach contents of 823 specimens, ranging from 70 to 875~mm total length, were analysed. Their diet included organisms from 17 taxa. The highest vacuity index values were found during autumn and winter. The stomach fullness index indicated that flounders increased their feeding activity between October and March, reaching a highest point in February and decreasing after February. Fish were the primary prey item in frequency, number and weight, followed by crustaceans, such as shrimps and crabs. A seasonal and size class variation was detected in the diet. During summer all-size flounders consumed mainly fish. In autumn, for all-size classes the main food were fish and crustaceans even though fish were dominant in terms of biomass. In spring, crustaceans (mysids Arthromysis magellanica (Cunningham), shrimps Artemesia longinaris Bate, and prawns Pleoticus muelleri (Bate)) were the dominant prey in terms of number and biomass for flounders {$\leq$} 450~mm TL. Size classes larger than 451~mm TL fed on crustaceans and fish though the most important prey item in terms of biomass was fish. In Bah\'ia Blanca estuary,P. orbignyanus evidenced mainly an ichthyophagou \textendash{} carcinophagous diet. The results collected from the present study lead to conclude that P. orbignyanus shows, in this region, a clear preference for fish.},

For the reproductive study, 423 individuals were obtained in 12 research cruises between 2000 and 2004. Reproductive parameters were analyzed in two oceanographic systems, the Rio de La Plata estuary (ERLP), Argentine-Uruguayan waters, and the El Rincon (ER), Argentina, Buenos Aires Prov. The feeding habits were analyzed using 329 stomach contents of individuals taken in ERLP (264)and ER (65 ER). For this study the individuals were reproductively (adults and juveniles)and seasonality (fall-winter and spring-summer)grouped. In ERLP the maximum total length was 920 mm for females and 865mm for males; in ER the maximum TL for females was 940 mm and for males 890 mm. In ER females matured at larger size than ERLP females and have larger total weight for a give total length. Three reproductive stages were observed in adult females: 1)adult, not pregnant with low GSI and small ovarian follicles, 2)adult not pregnant with high GSI and large ovarian follicles, and 3)pregnant females. The simultaneous occurrence of females in stages 1 and 2 indicates that maturation of the oocytes takes 2 years and implies that the female reproductive cycle is triennial. Alar spines were a dimorphic character due to their absence in neither females nor juvenile males. S. guggenheim could be a depth migratory species, seasonal differences in density were observed between spring and winter. The diet of S. guggenheim was composed of 33 preys, including Teleost, Chondricthyans, Crustacea and Squids. The most consumed prey was Cynoscion guatucupa (. IRI = 7.28. ) following by Prionotus nudigula (1.7. ), Engraulis anchoita (1.6. ) and Raneya brasiliensis (1.52. ). The number and TL of preys were increased with the predators TL.},

Several seabird species exploit discards from fisheries as their main food. The southern giant petrel Macronectes giganteus is a wide-ranging procellariform. It is considered a near-threatened species under International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and has been included as a threatened species in the Appendix 2 of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. The diet of Patagonian colonies of this species remains unknown, even though understanding the relationship between southern giant petrels and fisheries may be crucial to the conservation of this species in the Southwestern Atlantic. We describe the diet of the southern giant petrel from north Patagonian colonies using chick regurgitations and evaluate its relationships with the fisheries. Carrion occurred in the diets of 90.8\% of birds sampled, while cephalopods occurred in the diets of 65.1\%. Crustaceans were present in 43.7\% of samples and fishes in 19.4\%. Anthropogenic items were found in 72.7\% of the samples. The presence in the petrel diet of target and discarded species from fishery vessels, and the high incidence of marine debris, suggests an extensive use of discard over the Patagonian Shelf. The population of southern giant petrels in northern Patagonia has reached higher, stable levels. Such a population trend could be linked, at least partially, to the use of fisheries discards.},

The Argentinian national fishing fleet in the area is composed of approximately 208 vessels (75\% trawlers; 16\% jiggins; 9\% longliners). The fleet operates the year-round from eight harbours between Escondida Island and San Jorge Gulf (80 000 naut. miles2). The important target species are: hake (Merluccius hubbsi), shortfin squid (IIlex argentinus) and shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri), while several tons of other fish are discarded. The dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), the Commerson's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii) and the southern sea lion (Otaria flavescens) are incidentally caught. The dolphins become entangled mainly in mid-water trawls at night, while the sea lions become entangled in any kind of trawl. Annual mortality rates obtained are 170-480 sea lions (mostly males; figure estimated to be 1\textendash 2\% of the population size in the area), 70\textendash 200 dusky dolphins (70\% females) and 25\textendash 170 Commerson's dolphins. Feeding habits of top predators, fish catch and bycatch of the fishery were also studied. Dusky dolphins in the area prey mainly on anchovy and squid, while hake was the most important food item for Commerson's dolphins and male southern sea lions. Squid is also important prey for sea lions and overlaps in size with the fish taken by the commercial fishery. Fishing areas for squid taken by jigging vessels overlap in part with those of foraging sea lions. Even though the commercial size for hake is 30 cm or larger, smaller hakes are largely discarded by the fishery. A combination of operational and specific interactions have been detected. At present, mortality rates seem to be low and there is insufficient evidence of competition for prey species. However, there is concern about the large amounts of fish (particularly hake) discarded by the fishery.},

Dusky dolphins are an integral part of several marine ecosystems of the southern hemisphere. Among other cetaceans, pinnipeds, seabirds, and sharks, dusky dolphins represent the near-terminal links in the food webs in which they are embedded. This set of species is also referred to as the ``top predators'' or ``upper trophic level predators'' and the study of the trophic role dusky dolphins play in marine ecosystems is driven mostly by the same interests that one has in top predators. The goal of this chapter is to briefly summarize what is known about their trophic ecology and to attempt to develop, within the limitations of the available data, an initial description of the trophic role of dusky dolphins in their ecosystems. To achieve this goal, several topics are presented, including diet and feeding habits, relationships with other top predators, competition and kleptoparasitism, the role in the transmission of parasites, and finally their trophic relationships with fisheries.},

  abstract = {This study quantifies and describes the diet composition and variability, and the trophic ecology of Sympterygia bonapartii (Batoidea: Arhynchobatidae) in the San Mat\'ias Gulf, northern Patagonia, Argentina. A total of 1,047 stomachs were analyzed and 98~\% of them contained food. The low proportion of empty stomachs recorded and the presence of prey in different stages of digestion suggested that this skate was a continuous feeder. A total of 81 prey items were identified. However, the diet was mainly composed of crabs. Other important groups in its diet were teleost fishes, shrimps and prawns, bivalves and worms. At the species level, the crab Peltarion spinosulum accounted for the highest contribution and the anchovy Engraulis anchoita ranked second in importance. By analyzing its diet composition, it was possible to classify S. bonapartii as a benthic predator, as are other skates reaching a similar maximum size. In addition, it was placed in the functional group of species that mainly feeds on decapod crustaceans. Trophic level was estimated at 3.61, indicating that the species was a secondary consumer. Significant differences were found in the diet according to sex, size class and season. These differences may be due to extrinsic and intrinsic factors that could be operating together.},

We worked with the fishing fleet operating at Golfo San Jorge with onboard observers over 200 days in 1995-1997, sampling fishery by-catch and entangled birds. Penguins were affected during the austral summer. Estimations of mortality rates showed 0.33\% of the breeding population at Golfo San Jorge is incidentally killed by the shrimp fishery every summer. By-catch in shrimp fishery nets was composed of species important as penguin prey (anchovy and hake) in higher proportions during summer. The daily by-catch of these species was higher than the total calculated daily intake for all penguins breeding in the Golfo San Jorge. This could have a significant effect on birds. We recommend that an observer program be implemented to monitor seabird mortality and that fishing gear should be improved to reduce the indirect effect of the fish by-catch on penguins.},

The stomach contents of 3323 individual captured in research cruises carried out during 2004 and 2005 was determined. In the diet 39 prey items were identified corresponding to 4 Phyla. Trophic spectrum was determined with Index of Relative Importance (IRI), where fishes were the principal prey (72,53 percentage IRI), crustaceans were secondary prey (27,44 percentage IRI) and with minor values polychaetes and mollusk (0,2 percentageIRI) were found. Pelagic fish was the predominant food item and Engraulis anchoita (75, 02 percentage IRI) was the most important prey along the year and in both study areas.  Other fish item were the horse mackerel (Trachurus lathami, 2,56 percentage IRI) and the anchovy (Anchoa marinii, 0,56 percentage IRI). The crustacean Peisos petrunkevitchi (11,75 percentage IRI) was the most important and in second order Argentine stiletto shrimp (Artemesia longinaris, 0,81 percentage IRI) y Argentine red shrimp langostino (Pleoticus muelleri, 0,51 percentage IRI) were found. There is not any differences in diet of both sexes. C.  guatucupa it is a  predator specialist in pelagic fish. According to trophic level C. guatucupa was considered tertiary consumer. Significant differences were found when comparing the diet among individuals in both study areas mainly due to the biggest contribution of fish.

Squalus acanthias (Squalidae) and  Raja flavirostris (=Dipturus chilensis )(Rajidae), are two elasmobranchs with high apparition frequencies in the SW Atlantic, in the coastal and demersal fishing trawls, co-existing and predating on the principal stocks of bony fish there located, especially the Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi). Both species could be transformed into alternative fishing resources, even though they are not currently commercially developed as such. The knowledge on their biology, given in great detail, will provide information for a better conservation and management, since their own elasmobranch characteristics (slow growth, late first maturity and reduced number of pups of great size), make them highly vulnerable to intensive fisheries. Information was taken from 19 research cruises, held by the R/Vs of the National Institute of Fisheries Research and Development (INIDEP, Mar del Plata, Argentina) during 1985 and 1998 in the area between 34\textdegree and 56\textdegree S. The geographical and seasonal distribution by size of  S.acanthias  and R.flavirostris is analyzed during an annual cycle, in relation with the environmental factors. Comments on its reproductive characteristics and a synthesis on the evolution of their fisheries in the Argentine Sea are made.Trophic spectrum, interspecific trophic relationships and predation on Argentine hake are studied considering three zones, 1) Argentine-Uruguyan Common Fishing Area including southern Buenos Aires (34\textdegree -41\textdegree S); 2) northern Patagonia (41\textdegree -48\textdegree S); and 3) southern Patagonia (48\textdegree -56\textdegree S).

The diet of Cayenne and Royal Terns comprised nine and 10 prey species respectively. Fish comprised {$>$}99\% of the prey of both species of tern in the two study years. Both species had a fairly specialised diet based on pelagic schooling fish, mostly Argentine Anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) and two species of silversides (Odontesthes spp.). Despite observed overlap in trophic resources, our results showed that Argentine Anchovy was the main prey for Royal Terns, whereas the two species of silversides together with Anchovy comprised the bulk of the diet for Cayenne Terns. Fish delivered by Cayenne Terns were significantly smaller than those by Royal Terns. Results suggested that both type and size of prey may be important factors permitting food partitioning between the two species of tern during the breeding season.},

The Argentine red shrimp fishery consists of a double-beam trawler fleet with 80 freezer vessels, responsible for more than 75\% of shrimp landings in Argentina. The main problem of both fisheries is the bycatch of hake in one of its principle nursery areas.

Intraspecific and interspecific kleptoparasitism were significantly more frequent than expected in Kelp Gulls and Black-browed Albatrosses, respectively. Robbing efficiency was clearly higher in albatrosses than gulls. In both species, sizes of prey consumed by direct capture were significantly smaller than those stolen, and the rate of kleptoparasitism increased with prey size. Gulls stole significantly smaller prey than albatrosses. Prey selection by Kelp Gulls is affected by the interaction with Black-browed Albatrosses, and the degree at which discards are used by both species appears to depend on the fishery considered, the food on offer and the selection of prey sizes according to seabird species-specific preferences.},

Diet studies are key to assess the relative contribution of discards in their trophic ecology, and to start to understand the potential effects of fishing activities on their breeding parameters and population dynamics. The present study analyzes the dietary composition of Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus) breeding on the northern coast of Golfo San Jorge, Chubut, Argentina, during the 2007 breeding season in three sites: Isla Vernacci Sudoeste (45\textdegree 11'S, 66\textdegree 31'O), Isla Felipe (45\textdegree 04'S, 66\textdegree 19'O) and Isla Laguna (45\textdegree 02'S, 65\textdegree 53'O). Three sampling periods were selected: incubation, small chicks and large chicks. Diet samples were obtained through stomach flushing. The results obtained in the three colonies analyzed confirm that on the northern Patagonian coast the Kelp Gull is a generalist and opportunistic species that feeds during the breeding season on a wide variety of prey, mainly fish and marine invertebrates. During the large chick stage, frequency of occurrence of fish increased while that of polychaetes decreased. Fish were the most frequent prey in the Golfo San Jorge, represented mainly by the Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi), a demersal species that is in general inaccessible for surface predators like the Kelp Gull. It is highly likely that Argentine hake consumed by Kelp Gulls comes mainly from fishing discards. Future studies should evaluate spatio-temporal patterns in the distribution of fishing vessels and their relation with the proportion of fishery discards in Kelp Gull diet.},

This work describes the predator-prey behaviour of killer whales and South American sea lion associated to a trawling fishery. Particularly in Argentina the predatory behaviours of killer whales and anti-predatory behaviours of South American sea lions were described from land-based observations from coast, but predator-prey behaviour of these species is poorly known from open waters. Here we account of a killer whale group attacking on an individual sea lion, of a video recorded from a trawling vessel, along with an interview of the ship captain. This predator-prey behaviour represents an example on the complexity of interactions between marine mammals and fisheries along Patagonia coast.},

At Isla Felipe, the crabs Cyrtograpsus altimanus and C. angulatus were present in 91.2\% and 89.2\% of pellets, respectively, while the percentage contribution of each species was 76.1\% and 21.7\%, respectively. At Isla Vernaci Sudoeste, the figures were similar (96.2\% and 80\% of pellets, and percentage contributions 79.4\% and 19.5\%). All other taxa were present in less than 11\% of pellets. No significant differences were found between colonies in the number of prey items, prey individuals per pellet, and consumption of crabs. Percentage contribution of crabs differed significantly between stages of the breeding cycle at Isla Felipe but not at Isla Vernaci Sudoeste. At both colonies, the proportion of male C. altimanus in pellets was larger than that of females. The proportion of female C. angulatus in pellets at Isla Vernaci Sudoeste was larger than that of males, but no significant differences were found in the consumption of each sex at Isla Felipe. Mean maximum carapace width of male crabs in pellets was not significantly different from that of females at either Isla Felipe or Isla Vernaci. Our study at Golfo San Jorge confirms that Olrog's Gull is fairly specialized, feeding mainly on crabs during the breeding season.},

The killer whales at Punta Norte offer an unusually detailed view of association patterns and foraging behaviour, and suggest a pattern of behaviour that optimizes hunting efficiency with exception only to strong associations between some individuals and the provisioning and training of offspring. The main points from this paper are as follows: First, hunting effort was concentrated where the capture rate was greatest. All pods selectively attacked the prey type for which they had the highest capture rate. The amount of southern sea lion prey captured was approximately equal to the estimated minimum energetic requirement for killer whales based on weight. Secondly, one whale in each pod did the majority of the hunting, and then provisioned the others in the pod. It was clear on numerous occasions that food was shared. A review of reported incidences of killer wales taking marine mammal prey suggests that it is common for a subset of the individuals in a pod to hunt. These results are discussed in the context of the evolution of foraging behaviour.},

Both colonies are located within the Patagonia Austral marine park, and commercial trawl fisheries operate in adjacent waters, thus knowledge of their food requirement is fundamental to assess potential conflicts and monitor interactions. We obtained stomach samples from 63 adult Imperial Cormorants during the chick-rearing period in 2014: 32 at Isla Arce and 31 at Isla Vernaci Este. We recorded 27 and 30 prey taxa in stomach samples at Isla Arce and Isla Vernaci Este, respectively, and at least 21 were common to both islands. Significant differences in diet composition in terms of importance by mass were found between young and old chick stages at Isla Arce but not at Isla Vernaci Este. Rock cod (Patagonotothen spp.) were dominant at Isla Vernaci Este during both chick stages (75.7\% and 86.5\%, respectively). At Isla Arce, rock cod, Argentine anchovy (Engraulis anchoita), and Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi) contributed similarly to their diet (26\textendash 33\%) during the young chick stage, whereas Argentine anchovy dominated during the old chick stage (76.6\%). Diet composition in terms of importance by mass was significantly different between colonies. Imperial Cormorant consumed benthic, demersal, and pelagic prey, confirming plasticity in feeding habits, but their contribution differed depending on the site and chick stage. Our results suggest that diet assessments and monitoring the potential interaction between Imperial Cormorant and fisheries should not be based on information from a single breeding stage or location, but requires the analysis of diet composition throughout the breeding cycle with a representative sampling of the 17 colonies within the marine park.},

Crustaceans, mainly Themisto gaudichaudii and, to a lesser extent, euphausiids were the most important components of the diet in both areas and years, although there were considerable geographical differences in the relative proportion of the main prey. In the Patagonian area, during summer and autumn of 1992, almost all squid preyed on crustaceans (percentage occurrence = 85.29\%), followed by squid (11.76\%) and fish (2.94\%). On the Bonaerensis shelf, during autumn and winter of 1991, crustaceans were most important by percentage occurrence (56.96\%), but fish and squid accounted for a large proportion of the diet (29.41\% and 13.62\% respectively). Myctophids were prevalent among the fish and cannibalism was on I. argentinus juveniles. Changes in diet composition with squid size demonstrated the opportunistic nature of I. argentinus feeding. Although large squids were able to catch large prey (fish, squid), they also fed on small crustaceans when available, especially in the Patagonian area. The relative abundance of different prey organisms probably determined the diet. In both areas and both years I. argentinus fed mostly during daylight hours, starting in the morning and reaching a maximum in the afternoon. No difference in feeding behaviour was observed between the sexes.},

  abstract = {The comparative analysis of the food habits between top predator allows the evaluation of how  these species use the trophic resources. They also make possible the study of potentially competitive  relationships and the role of these predators in the regulation and structure of the community. The marine  community of northern and central Patagonia is structured on the tri-trophic system composed by the  Argentine anchovy (Engraulis anchoita), the Argentine shortfin squid (Illex argentinus), and Argentine  hake (Merluccius hubbsi). Several marine mammals and elasmobranchs use these species as food  resources. For this reason, the objective of this work was to analyze comparatively the diet of the South  American sea lion (Otaria flavescens), the dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), the Commerson's  dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii), the beaked skate (Raja flavirostris), the spiny dogfish (Squalus  acanthias) and the school shark (Galeorhinus galeus).  The diet of these predators was studied by stomach content analysis. The prey remains found in the  contents (fish bones and otoliths, cephalopod beaks, crustacean exoskeletons, etc.) were used to identify  and quantify the preys. The length and weight of prey at the moment of the ingestion were estimated by  alometric regressions.  The relative importance of prey species was evaluated by the relative importance index  IRI=(PH\%+N\%)FO\%, where PH\% is the percent in wet weight, N\% is the percent in number, and FO\% is  the frequency of occurrence of the prey species in the diet. This index was relativized to 100\% (IRI\%).  Intraspecific differences in diet allow the determination of trophospecies within a biological species.  These differences were evaluated using the general overlap (GO) and the specific overlap (SO) index.  These index were calculated using the occurrences of those prey species which had IRI\% values greater  than 1\% in the total sample of the biological species. Differences in the sizes consumed by the  trophospecies were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney test or the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric one way  ANOVA and paired comparisons.  The diet of the South American sea lion was studied using samples obtained from animals found  dead on the beach and incidentally caught by the fishery. Forty-one prey species were identified from the  59 stomachs analyzed. The most important prey were the Argentine hake, the red octopus (Enteroctopus  megalocyathus), the raneya (Raneya brasiliensis), the Patagonian squid (Loligo gahi), and the Argentine  anchovy. The differences in the diet associated with the source of sampling (dead on beach or entangled)  and sex were evaluated using the GO and SO. Only differences between sexes were found.  The dusky dolphin diet was studied from a sample of 25 dolphins. Most of this sample was obtained  from incidental catches in nocturnal midwater hauls directed to the capture of Argentine red shrimp  (Pleoticus muelleri). Intraspecific differences in the diet were not analyzed due the small sample size.  The diet of the beaked skate was studied from a sample of 274 individuals obtained from the  incidental catches of the hake fishery. The most important prey were the Argentine hake, the Southern cod  (Patagonotothen ramsayi), the Argentine shortfin squid, the isopod (Serolis schythei), the raneya, and the  Argentine anchovy. A total of 45 prey species were identified. The overlap analysis indicated no  differences in the diet between sexes, but significant differences in the diet between immature and mature  individuals.  The diet of the spiny dogfish was studied from a sample of 132 individuals obtained from the  incidental catches of the hake fishery between 1996 and 1998. The food habits were analyzed taking into  account the potential differences in diet related to sex and maturity condition. Using the GO and SO index,  differences in diet were found between immature individuals (SAinm), mature males (SAmm) and mature  females (SAhm).  The diet of the Commerson's dolphin was studied from 9 stomach contents obtained from  incidentally caught individuals. Even that this sample is small and only allows a preliminary analysis, the  Argentine hake and the Argentine shortfin squid were the most important prey species. The sizes of prey  indicate that the Commerson's dolphin fed on primary juveniles of hake and small juveniles of squid.  Then, it is reasonable to consider that this species, in the north and central Patagonia, is a pelagic predator  which feed on pelagic species or pelagic stages of species which exhibit schooling behavior.  The diet of the school shark was analyzed from 23 stomach contents obtained from individuals  incidentally caught in commercial hauls. The most important prey were the Argentine hake, the Argentine  shortfin squid and the red octopus, followed by the Southern cod and the Patagonian squid. Considering  the ecological groups of the prey, the school shark fed mostly on demersal-pelagic and benthic species,  suggesting that this predator feeds associated to the bottom. The sizes of the prey suggest that the school  shark consume its prey according to their environmental availability.  The inter-specific comparative diet analysis was made using the IRI\%, calculated for prey species  and ecological groups of prey. Considering the previous results and the sample sizes, the predator species  were divided in trophospecies. These trophospecies were the males (OFm) and females (OFh) of the South  American sea lion, the dusky dolphin (LO), the immature (RFinm) and mature (RFmad) individuals of the  beaked skate, the immature (SAinm), mature males (SAmm) and mature females (SAhm) of the spiny  dogfish, the Commerson's dolphin (CC) and the school shark (GG).  In order to determine if the sample size of each trophospecies was representative of the putative  population, the Pielou's pooled quadrat method and the Brillouin's diversity index were employed. Also,  this procedure was used to estimate the population trophic diversity (Hp) for each trophospecies. The Hp  were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test and paired comparisons. Additionally, two cluster analysis  were performed using the IRI\% for the prey species and the ecological groups of prey. The results indicate  that all the sample sizes were representative of the populations, with the exception of the CC sample. For  this reason, this species was excluded from the analysis. A gradient of Hp was detected, where OFh and  LO were the trophospecies which showed the maximum and minimum values for Hp respectively. This  gradient was positively correlated with the IRI\% of the benthic and demersal-benthic prey. It suggests that  the trophic diversity is reflecting the biological diversity of the environments where the trophospecies are  feeding. Moreover, this result indicates that all these predators could be considered as generalist and  opportunistic in the context of the environmental patch that they use as trophic habitat.  Considering the cluster analysis based on the IRI\% of the ecological groups of prey, three groups  were identified. These groups were related to the consumption of demersal-pelagic preys (OFm, RFmad,  SAmm, SAhm and GG), the high importance of pelagic preys (SAinm and LO), and the high importance  of demersal-benthic preys (OFh and RFinm).  Considering the IRI\% of the prey species, the cluster analysis allowed the identification of 6 groups  of predators. The ``OFm and RFmad'' group was characterized by the high importance of Argentine hake  in the diet. The ``GG'' group was characterized by a relatively even distribution of the importance of  Argentine hake, Argentine shortfin squid, and red octopus. The ``RFinm'' group presented high importance  of Southern cod, followed by Argentine hake and isopods. The ``SAinm, SAmm and SAhm'' was related to  the high importance of Argentine shortfin squid and the presence of ctenophores. The ``LO'' group was  defined by the high importance of Argentine anchovy, followed by Argentine shortfin squid and  Patagonian squid. The ``OFh'' group was defined by the high importance of red octopus in the diet.  The overlap analysis between trophospecies indicated that the overlaps were low, and always  significantly different to the complete overlap. Then, these top predators will used the same, abundant and  frequent, trophic resources, but in different ways according to their trophic habitats. These differential  uses of the food resources lead to a separation of their trophic niches and to reduce the possibility of  ecological competition between them.},

The samples were collected during 1982\textendash 1987 and 1990\textendash 1998 in northern and central Patagonia. The samples (n=59) came from individuals found dead on beaches and from animals recovered in incidental catches of the fi shery. Forty-one prey species (including fishes, cephalopods, crustaceans, gastropods, polychetes, sponges, and tunicates) were identified; most important were Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi), red octopus (Enteroctopus megalocyathus), Argentine shortfi n squid (Illex argentinus), ``raneya'' (Raneya brasiliensis), Patagonian squid (Loligo gahi), and Argentine anchovy (Engraulis anchoita). Differences in diet were found between sexes but not between geographical area of sampling, period of sampling, or source of samples. Females fed mostly on ben-thic species, whereas males fed mostly on demersal-pelagic species. The difference in diet between sexes was associated with different feeding grounds or different home ranges and could be produced by different constraints in the feeding behavior of each sex. These different constraints and restrictions could lead females to feed in more coastal and shallower waters than those waters where males feed. Some of the important prey were commercial species (Argentine hake, Argentine shortfin squid, Patagonian squid) consumed at both commercial and noncommercial sizes by sea lions. The presence of gastroliths was independent of the presence of stomach parasites; however, gastrolith weight was positively correlated with individual sea lion's length, indicating that gastroliths could be involved in buoyancy control. In summary, these stomach content analyses indicate that South American sea lions feed primarily on demersal and benthic species and, in general terms, use resources according to their environmental availability.},

Food habits were analyzed in relation to sex and maturity of sharks. Also, the relationship between diet and abundance of the main prey was explored. Intraspecific diet comparisons were performed. Differences in diet were found between immature individuals, mature males, and mature females. The Argentine shortfin squid Illex argentinus, the Argentine hake and ctenophores Pleurobrachia pileus were the most important prey for the spiny dogfish. Immature and small individuals were pelagic predators. After sexual maturity, the spiny dogfish shifted its diet. Mature and large individuals tended to reduce the consumption of ctenophores, and increase the consumption of demersal and benthic species. Previous diet studies on the spiny dogfish in 1984\textendash 1985 and 1994 indicated that the Argentine hake was the most important prey. In the present study, carried out in 1998, squid was the most important prey, followed by the hake. This diet change was related to the major decrease of hake due to overfishing and the increase of squid abundance between 1994 and 1999.},

Patagonotothen ramsayi had a moderately diverse diet that was mostly zooplankton, especially amphipods, but included benthos and discards from the fishery, especially squid. P. guntheri also had a moderately diverse zooplankton diet, especially copepods, and benthos and squid damaged by the fishery. The diet of P. tessellata was the most diverse and was mainly benthos, including damaged scallops, with some euphausiids and amphipods. Feeding niche overlap of fish between 10 and 20 cm TL for the three species was between 5.8 and 9.2\% for each pair of species, indicating relatively little overlap even though all species scavenged on organisms made available by the fishery. Thus the diet of these three Patagonotothen species indicates substantial feeding niche separation, and that the three species are moderately specialised feeders.},

Of the 408 individuals examined, 168 (41.2\%) had food remains in their stomachs. The proportion of individuals with food remains was negatively correlated with total length. In general, the diet was composed mainly of teleosts (98.5\% IRI [index of relative importance]), with invertebrates and chondrichthyans as minor prey. The diet varied ontogenetically and seasonally. Juveniles and adults differed in their consumption of invertebrates, with juveniles preying more on benthic invertebrates, mainly the octopus Octopus tehuelchus, and adults on squid. From December to February, adults preyed mainly on benthic teleosts (almost exclusively the Atlantic midshipman Porichthys porosissimus), while from March to April the consumption of squid increased. A comparison of numbers of prey in stomachs with abundance of prey in the environment in March and April showed that, in these months, juveniles selected invertebrates and demersal teleosts and avoided pelagic teleosts and chondricthyan prey, and adults selected squid and avoided pelagic teleosts. This indicates that, during this period, G. galeus is not an opportunistic predator. The mean size of prey increased with increasing shark length, but even large sharks consumed small prey. All shark sizes consumed prey fragments that were significantly larger than other prey consumed whole. This indicates that G. galeus is able to overcome gape limitation by mutilating prey, and that the ontogenetic diet shift was not due to a change in the ability to seize prey.},

Individuals (n = 147) were collected from 43 sampling stations in late summer and autumn 2001. Thirty one alimentary items in the gut contents were found, with a clear dominance of polychaetes. Crustaceans were secondary alimentary items. The polychaete Travisia kerguelensis was the main food item ingested, followed by Nepthyidae, Sabellidae and Lumbrineridae, while Gammaridae and Cirolanidae were the main items among crustaceans. The niche width and feeding strategy displayed by B. macloviana support the specialisation towards polychaetes throughout this study. Slow motile and infaunal species constitute major preys. The results suggest that this skate actively selects worms, reflecting, in some sense, the composition of the polychaete assemblage, and allowing a low dietary overlap with other sympatric skates of the ACS.},

Myliobatis goodie is an eagle ray reported from South Carolina in the USA (35\textdegree N) to Santa Cuz, Argentina (44\textdegree S), however little is known about this species, which is considered data deficient by the IUCN. In order to create adequate management strategies for this species, biological information is sorely needed. The objective of this study was to describe the biology of the population of M. goodei and its relationships with season, sex and the geographic features of Anegada Bay, Argentina (from 39.96\textdegree S to 40.60\textdegree S and from 62.10\textdegree W to 62.46\textdegree W) in 2008. Specifically, the population structure of M. goodie was studied by sex, seasons and sites, its food habits by seasons and sites, and the reproductive biology by seasons and sex. The results show that M. goodei exhibits seasonal migrations. Young-of-the-year remain in the bay all year long, while adults enter during spring and summer. Juveniles in spring are likely to become first-time mating individuals that migrate into open sea at the end of summer. These individuals would return to give birth for the first time and mate for the second time during the next year at summer. Anegada Bay would then be a mating and nursery area for the species. M. goodei behave as a generalist feeder with a uniform diet composed mainly of bivalves. Seasonal differences in the diet found arise from differences in prey diversity between summer and spring. Spatial differences, however, arise from the different abundances of caprellids and bivalves. Trophic level was 3.2 and it constitutes the first reference for this species, characterizing it as a secondary consumer.},

Prey richness was higher during January. The diet of A. australis varied between years, apparently related to changes in prey availability. C. guatucupa and E. anchoita decreased while T. lepturus and cephalopods increased from 1996 to 1998. South American fur seals fed on fish ranging in length from 5.4 to 104.8 cm and from 0.7 to 629.9 g in wet mass. However, the mean mass of the main items was never more than 200 g. Observations suggests that A. australis is a trophic generalist with the potential to prey on a wide range of species, although most of the diet is comprised of relatively few species.

  abstract = {The San Mat\'ias Gulf (SMG) is a semi-enclosed ecosystem where the Argentine hake Merluccius hubbsi (AH) has been the main fishery resource since 1971. During the 20th century the South American sea lion Otaria flavescens (SASL) population was severely reduced in this ecosystem due an intense hunting, but in the 1970's conservation was promoted and hunting was banned. As a consequence SASL have been slowly recovering, until the 1990's when rapidly rebuilt their populations. Recent studies indicate that they feed mostly over commercially profitable medium-sized AH. Also, medium-sized and large hake are well-known cannibals that feed heavily over smaller AH. Fishing trawlers affect juvenile and medium-sized AH and artisanal long-liners capture exclusively large AH. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a growing SASL population over the AH in the SMG, considering the changes in the fishing activity as well as the size-structured cannibalism within the AH population. The evaluations were based on time series of hake and SASL biomass using the ``Ecopath with Ecosim'' dynamic modelling approach. The analyses show that over 4 decades the increase in Sea Lions biomass has not generated a significant increase in the predation mortality over AH. On the other hand, an increase and subsequent variations in the fishing mortality seems to be related with long-term variations in large AH abundance, and a decrease in medium-sized AH abundance, constraining the cannibalism mortality. This led to a positive effect over juvenile AH abundance due to a released cannibalism pressure, even considering that the less abundant larger AH are also the main spawners of the population. In this scenario, where it seems that trawlers and long-liners have replaced several predators over the SMG food web, SLAS population is still growing but they may not reach the pristine abundance levels of the time before hunting.},

Allometric equations were employed toexamine differences in statolith shape and growth. Statolith dimensions were standardized by total length and dome length and principal components analysis was employed to compare the shapes. The first component was used as a discriminant function to classify species. There is clear species differentiation in both size and shape of the statoliths. The statoliths of Loligo gahi are significantly larger than those of Loligo sanpaulensis. Loligo gahi statoliths are characterized by the presence of a prominent dorsal dome and a relatively long, thin rostrum, whereas those of Loligo sanpaulensis have a rounded dome and short rostrum. The discriminant function correctly separated 92.9\% of Loligo gahi and 88.5\% of Loligo sanpaulensis statoliths in additional samples. Relationships between mantle length and statolith length and between total mass and statolith length were determined for both species.},

Imperial Cormorants and Rock Shags fed on at least 22 and 21 different types of prey, respectively. The main prey species during all study years were fish: Engraulis anchoita for Imperial Cormorants and Patagonothen sp. for Rock Shags. For both species, the consumption of the main food categories as estimated by pellet analysis was similar among years. A significant relationship was found between Imperial Cormorant and Rock Shag diets during the three years, while the diet overlap index was relatively high. During all years, Imperial Cormorants consumed a significantly larger proportion of pelagic or demersal fish than did Rock Shags, while Rock Shags consumed benthic fish in a greater proportion than did Imperial Cormorants. Mean maximum diving depth, determined using capillary tube depth gauges, of Imperial Cormorants (24.4 m {$\pm$} 18.8 SD) was significantly greater but more variable than that of Rock Shags (9.3 m {$\pm$} 4.1 SD).},

Persecution, catches, and tossing behavior were performed by the two females or immature males in the inlet. Next day, carcasses of several sharks were found on the beach adjacent to the attack area. Seven of them were intact and sized approximately 2.5 m in length. The presence of complete sevengill shark carcasses on the beach suggests that they were attempting to avoid capture by the killer whales by stranding on the beach. Attacks on sevengills by killer whales in Caleta Malaspina are frequent in some years, especially from midDecember to mid-January when the sevengill seems to use the inlet as a nursery ground. The observation of the same male feeding both on pinnipeds in Peninsula Valdes and on sharks in Caleta Malaspina may indicate that at least some groups in the Southwestern Atlantic could regularly feed on both fish and marine mammals. This is the first report of an attack of killer whales on sharks off the coast of Patagonia, and the first report of tossing behavior in sharks.},

Along growth, D. gahi shifted from crustaceans, mainly euphausiids to fish (Salilota australis) and squid (D. gahi and Histioteuthis sp.). Small to mid-sized I. argentinus and O. ingens consumed mostly two fish, two squid species D. gahi and Histioteuthis atlantica, two crustaceans Munida gregaria and Munida subrugosa and the Chaetognatha Sagitta elegans. All the three species show a high prey overlapping at similar sizes: Squid of smaller size (5\textendash 15cm ML) fed mainly on crustaceans: D. gahi on euphausiids and squat lobsters (Munididae). Mid-sized squid fed mainly on fish, most frequently Gymnoscopelus sp. and S. australis, and larger I. argentinus and O. ingens fed mostly on squids, including cannibalism. The overlapping of the diet of similar sized squid was large suggesting all preys are abundant species in autumn in the water column in the Patagonian Shelf.},

  abstract = {Competition for food could be a major force driving changes in the community structure of skates (Rajidae) subjected to fishing exploitation. Under this hypothesis, small skates are released from competition with larger skates after fishing has depleted the larger species. Here, we compare the abundance patterns of two sympatric skates with similar niches but different life histories, Bathyraja albomaculata (larger and slow-reproducing) and Bathyraja macloviana (smaller and faster-reproducing), before (1971, 1978) and after (1998-2004) a 108\% increase in industrial bottom trawling on the southeastern South American shelf in order to test the prediction that B. macloviana should competitively exclude B. albomaculata after the increase in fishing mortality. In 1971 and 1978, there was no relationship between the abundance of both species, indicating that they coexisted over large scales. In 1998-2004, the relationship between the abundances of these skates was bell-shaped, indicating that both species increased in abundance at low densities until peaking, after which B. albomaculata decreased when B. macloviana became more abundant, consistent with resource competition. We tested whether food may be a potential limiting resource by comparing the diet of both species. The two species consumed mostly polychaetes, differing only in the consumption of polychaetes from the family Nephthyidae, which was much higher for B. macloviana. Bathyraja macloviana could replace B. albomaculata at high densities when food resources may become scarce. These results support the hypothesis that competition release is an important factor explaining the changes in skate communities in overexploited areas.},

  abstract = {Hydrography and spatial patterns of mesozooplankton communities in a frontal area off northern Patagonian were investigated in spring 1995 and 1998. Differential wind/tidal relative forcing appeared to drive along-shelf variations in the physical structure of the front and hence, planktonic patterns. Approaching the northern border of the system, the conspicuous presence of Oithona helgolandica, cladocerans and appendicularians, and the low fecundities of calanoid copepods suggest that a high proportion of the primary production may be channelled through microheterotrophic processes. Towards the southern area, calanoids dominated over cyclopoids, `large\textasciiacute{} species (Drepanopus forcipatus, Calanoides cf. carinatus) were abundant, and copepod fecundities were high and steady, suggesting that there may be a more classical-like herbivorous food web. Paracalanus parvus and Ctenocalanus vanus occurred over the whole system but seemed to be key species in mixed and weakly stratified waters. Copepods peaked in stratified waters away from the front itself, while the abundance of eggs and nauplii was highest in weakly stratified waters next to the front. Apparently, the general heating occurring over the region in spring 1998 strongly affected both the physical and biological structure of the system. Unlike in 1995, a massive bloom of gelatinous zooplankton took place in 1998 and a bloom of the phagotrophic dinoflagellate Noctiluca sp. occurred in the northern area. Co-occurring copepod populations were depressed and their reproductive patterns seemed to be highly disrupted. Present observations stress the significance of variable external forcing in driving satisfactory habitat conditions for juvenile fish in the area.},

Fish recruitment seems to be influenced by environmental variability; the plankton would act as a link between both processes. While environmental variability can be explained in terms of physical forcing, recruitment variability is partly determined by the survival of early larvae. In this review, the available information on hydrography and plankton in relation to reproduction and feeding of hake and anchovy in the Patagonian spawning ground was summarized and integrated. The objective was to assess what is actually known about the environmental and planktonic features of the region that may have an effect on the recruitment of both species. In the Patagonian spawning ground, detection, in summer, of two major frontal systems of different nature, with a high planktonic production that would coincide with the spawning and nursery areas of hake and anchovy must be mentioned. Hence, it is suggested to test for the local species some well-known hypotheses about the possible physically-mediated mechanisms that may have an impact on the growth and survival of larvae and juveniles.},

Overlaping in the diet among these predators was estimate using cluster analysis. There was an interespecific diet overlap between juveniles belonging to demersal-benthic fish species, because all of them prey upon Stomatopoda and Munida. Adults from those species and hake prefered young and adult hake as preys, while Macruronus magellanicus and juvelines Merluccius hubbsi ate mainly zooplankton. In addition, there were son seasonal changes in prey species preferences, but food habits changed considerably with fish size.},

  abstract = {Peale's dolphin, Lagenorhynchus australis, is a common but little known species from southern South America. A review of the literature produced several observations of feeding behaviour, but only four reports on the examination of stomach contents of this species; all four were from the Cl\textbackslash St coast of the continent in the southern South Atlantic. The seven animals sampled had fed on Argentine shrimp (P/eoticus muelleri), small octopus, three species of squid (Loligo gahi; Ill ex argentinus), kingklip fish (Genypterus h/acodes), Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi) and southern cod (Salilota austral is). These species are common in the waters of the Patagoniun shelf. We report on further observations on dolphin feeding during regular shore-based studies along the central Strait of Magellan and un nine specimens from Tierm del Fuego, seven from the northeastern Atlantic coast and two young animals from the northeastern coast of the Beagle Channel. All nine animals probably died incidentally in shore-based nets set for Patagonian blenny (Eieginops mac/ovinus). We found at least 15 taxa represented in the stomach contents: eight species of fish, three of cephalopods, one bivalve mollusc, two crustaceans and one species of salp. The salps had been taken by the youngest dolphins, which also had milk in their stomachs. The most important prey species were bottom fish: hagfish (Myxine australis), southern cod (Salilota australis) and Patagonian grenadier (Macrumnus magetlanicus), followed by the red octopus (Enteroctopus mega!otyathus) and Patagonian squid (L. gahi.). The remaining species, among others Sprattus jitegensis and Ill ex argentinus, were marginal or perhaps items ingested by the other actual prey species. The feeding ecology ofPeale's dolphin off northeastern Ticrra del Fuego seems to be associated with demersal and bottom species captured in or near kelp beds.},

Killer whales or orcas (Orcinus orca) and southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) coexist in the waters off Pen\'insula Vald\'es, Argentina. Over the last three decades, right whales have changed their distribution along the Peninsula by abandoning the area with the highest occurrence of orcas and moving into two adjacent bays. Between 1972 and 2000, 117 orca \textendash{} right whale encounters were observed. From 112 encounters, 63 (56.3\%; mean duration x =12.3 min) involved no apparent changes in the behavior of either species; in 37 encounters (33\%; x =27.6 min) obvious behavioral changes were seen; and in 12 encounters (10.7\%; x =81.1 min) actual attacks were observed. The orca / right whale ratio was maximum (1.8 orcas per right whale) in actual attacks, and minimum (1.3 orcas per right whale) in the other two categories. Most encounters (90.6\%) occurred along the Eastern Outer Coast of the Peninsula. Here, the overall number of encounters decreased with time, from 68 in 1972-1980, to 26 in 1981-1990, to 23 in 1991-2000. However, while encounters decreased along the Eastern Outer Coast they increased in other areas. Orcas may assess right whale group size and their own group size before approaching and attacking. During encounters, right whales showed behaviors (active calf protection, use of tail as a weapon, use of shallow waters, increased group size, rosette formation) that could be adaptive to decrease predation success. The aggregation of right whales on nursery grounds such as Pen\'insula Vald\'es has been proposed to be an adaptation to reduce individual predation risk. The abandonment of the Eastern Outer Coast by right whales has lowered the number of encounters with orcas with a subsequent decrease in the attack rate over time. At present it is not possible to determine whether predation pressure caused the change in habitat use by right whales in Vald\'es. However, our data suggest that the `predation hypothesis' could partly explain the shift of southern right whales into the bays.},

Discopyge tschudii preyed mainly on polychaetes. The consumption of polychaetes was higher in males. Also, amphipods and siphons of clams were preyed more heavily in the cold season and Munida gregaria in the warm season. Stomatopods were consumed more with increasing body size. All prey categories were independent of maturity stage. We concluded that D. tschudii is a benthic feeder.},

Since previous knowledge about larval feeding of the species in this region is fragmentary, adequate information is required for a complete assessment of its importance in the food web and its effect upon recruitment. Our primary objective was to examine the feeding strategy of M. hubbsi larvae in relation with prey availability in the nursery ground. Feeding incidence was 87\%; hake larvae consumed mainly calanoid copepodites {$<$}2mm in size, which were preferred prey upon more available items, and that may be nutritionally beneficial for larvae. Hake larvae were specialist at a population level toward such prey, with a narrow trophic niche. There was a clear trophic diel pattern in the number of prey ingested. Results indicate that the nursery area might be favorable for a successful feeding of hake larvae while they grow and develop. Data provided here are relevant not only to determine trophic interactions in the region but also to identify possible causes of recruitment success.},

  abstract = {Coastal temperate rocky reefs are economically valuable and highly diverse, yet the trophodynamics of these productive systems are understudied. Quantifying the trophic linkages that support fish assemblages on these reefs is valuable for understanding how these assemblages may change due to changes in benthic and pelagic primary production. The goal of this study was to quantify the relative importance of primary sources of nutrition (here, macroalgae, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus) for supporting fish assemblages on shallow rocky reefs. We constructed a general food web that traces the food sources supporting fish biomass on shallow temperate reefs near Sydney, Australia, using species composition data from 17 reefs based on field sampling and the Reef Life Survey (reeflifesurvey.com), and combined this with dietary information sourced from field collections and published literature. Planktivorous fish typically dominated reef fish assemblages, comprising an average of 41\% of the total fish biomass (ranging from 12 to 71\% among sites). Our food web analysis showed that, on average, 56\% ({$\pm$}5\% s.e.) of the total fish biomass was ultimately supported by phytoplankton (and 53\% from zooplankton), in comparison to 31\% ({$\pm$}4\%) supported by macroalgae and 12\% ({$\pm$}2\%) by detritus. This result highlights the dominance of zooplanktivorous fish on temperate reefs and also their importance as prey for piscivores. Our findings demonstrate the importance of understanding the coastal dynamics of plankton and planktivory for predicting the response of temperate reefs and their fish assemblages to a changing climate.},

Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios from 54 adult male fur seals dead stranded along the coast of southern Brazil from 1994 to 2011 were analysed to investigate whether the intensification of fishing in R\'io de la Plata and adjoining areas since the mid-1990s has reduced the availability of benthic and demersal prey to the growing population of South American fur seals.No significant correlation between {$\delta$}13C or {$\delta$}15N values and stranding year was found, thus revealing that fur seals maintained a steady diet over 17 years.Reconstruction of the isotopic landscape of the study area using potential prey of fur seals showed a spatial segregation, with prey from southern Brazil typically enriched in 13C and depleted in 15N compared with those from northern Argentina. Most adult male fur seals relied mainly on small pelagic fishes and squid captured on the continental shelf, whereas medium pelagic and demersal\textendash benthic prey played a minor role in the diet.It is concluded that South American fur seals rely on pelagic resources (i.e. small pelagic fish and squid) more strongly than previously thought and that their diet does not reflect the varying abundance of demersal\textendash benthic resources in the area.As long as small pelagic fish remain under-exploited in the area, competition between fisheries and fur seals is not expected. However, it is difficult to foresee how changes in the structure and dynamics of the ecosystem caused by fisheries may affect South American fur seal conservation in the long term.

  abstract = {1. We examined the effects of multiple predators from an intertidal boulder food web to test whether and how three different predator species affected the survival of a small amphipod species. 2. Predators were chosen because they differ in their foraging mode, two feeding at the bottom and in benthic refuges (nemertean and shrimp) and one in the water-column (juveniles of a fish). 3. Mortality of amphipods was not affected by nemerteans, but was high in the presence of shrimp or fish. Highest mortalities were observed in predator-combinations that contained both shrimp and fish. Amphipods responded to shrimp by escaping into the water column, while they avoided fish by remaining in the refuge. We conclude that predator-specific defence causes conflicts for prey when both shrimp and fish are present. 4. Comparing observed effects of multiple predators with expected effects revealed risk enhancement for the shrimp + fish combination. A comparison of different predictive models revealed that the multiplicative model was most appropriate, although additive models may work well under certain conditions. 5. Based on known consumption-ranges of the predators used, we conclude that nemerteans were saturated with prey while fish were far from their saturation point. A predator's functional response curve (prey consumption in relation to prey abundance) determines its impact on prey populations. This knowledge appears essential in order to predict whether prey organisms face risk enhancement, risk reduction or additive effects of multiple predators.}

In order to reduce prey detection and handling time, individuals must actively select their foraging space (microhabitat) and populations exhibit morphologies that are best suited for capturing locally available prey. We explored how variation in diet correlates with habitat type, and how these factors influence key morphological structures (mouth gape, eye diameter, fin length, fin area, and pectoral fin ratio) in a common microcarnivorous cryptic reef fish species, the triplefin Helcogrammoides cunninghami. In a mensurative experiment carried out at six kelp-dominated sites, we observed considerable differences in diet along 400 km of the Chilean coast coincident with variation in habitat availability and prey distributions. Triplefins preferred a single prey type (bivalves or barnacles) at northern sites, coincident with a low diversity of foraging habitats. In contrast, southern sites presented varied and heterogeneous habitats, where triplefin diets were more diverse and included amphipods, decapods, and cumaceans. Allometry-corrected results indicated that some morphological structures were consistently correlated with different prey items. Specifically, large mouth gape was associated with the capture of highly mobile prey such as decapods, while small mouth gape was more associated with cumaceans and copepods. In contrast, triplefins that capture sessile prey such as hydroids tend to have larger eyes. Therefore, morphological structures co-vary with habitat selection and prey usage in this species. Our study shows how an abundant generalist reef fish exhibits variable feeding morphologies in response to the distribution of potential habitats and prey throughout its range.},

The diet of juveniles was closely related to the pelagic food web (copepods and euphausids), whereas adults consumed benthic organisms (polychaetes, echinoderms and gammarid amphipods). Such a trend was more evident among larger fish.},

  abstract = {An assessment survey on the austral fish was carried out during the summer 1997 on both the shelf and slope off southern Argentina. The cruise covered 101,508 nm2 between 45\textdegree{} and 54\textdegree{} 30'S and depths between 50 and 400 m. The survey did not include the area controlled by the United Kingdom. Considering the total area as an undivided stratum, a random sampling was used to estimate demersal fish biomass and a delta distribution-based model to evaluate mean densities. Out of the forty five species caught 28 were bony fish and 17 elasmobranch. Four cephalopod mollusc species were also identified. A biomass of 3.2 million tons (CI(95o/o): 1.90 - 6.06 millions) proved that longtail hake was the most abundant resource within the region followed by common hake (590,000 tons), patagonian cod and notothenids (slightly over 200,000 tons each). Pink cuskeel reached almost 190,000 tons. Among other fish species, only Psammobatis spp: rayswere over 100,000 tons. The main longtail hake concentrations (100 t/nm2) were found between 48\textdegree{} and 52\textdegree{} 30\textasciiacute S at water depths between 50 - 100 m. Size distribution of longtail hake ranged 18 - 110 cm TL with a mode at 54 cm. Fitting of length(cm) - weight (g) relationship parameters resulted in W = 0.0099 * TL 2.7215.  Length at 50 percent first maturity (TL(50o/o)) was estimated at 59.4 cm. Distribution patterns, maximum densities, size structures, length - weight relationship and length at 50 percent maturity related to the other above mentioned species are also reported. From 2,669 otolith readings, length growthparameters corresponding to longtail hake were estimated as follows: L?= 88.15 cm TL; K = 0.245 year-1 and t0 = -0.425 years (males) and L? = 100.92 cm TL; K = 0.190 year-1 and t0 = -0.610 years (females). Significant differences between sexes were observed. Age group 3 (year class 1993) was the most abundant (2,600 millions of individuals). Natural mortality (M) estimates for the species ranged 0.22 - 0.269 whereas total mortality (Z) between ages 4 and 11 was estimated to be 0.335. Studies on fish feeding showed that longtail hake, southern blue whiting and common hake ate mainly zooplankton species such as amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii and euphausiid Euphausia lucens as well as small fish(notothenids, longtail hake juveniles, anchovies, sprats). Other predators, including pink cuskeel, southern hake, patagonian cod, spiny dogfish and Raja flavirostris fed mainly on macrocrustaceans, cephalopods (squid and octopus) and fish(notothenids and longtail hake). Cannibalism, representing 65 percent of the total longtail hake ingested, would be exerted only on young-of-the-year fish whereas predation would be suffered by 0 to 3 year old fish. Nematod Anisakis sp. was responsible for the high degree of parasitism found in southern blue whiting. Different parasites were identified in gills, mesentery,liver, stomach, pyloric caeca and gut.Sea surface temperature ranged 7.5 - 12.5\textdegree C. A thermic front (0.02\textdegree C/km) was found between 50\textdegree{} and 51\textdegree S. Bottom temperature decreased as waters became deeper. Encounter on the shelf of low salinitycoastal waters ( 33.2 psu) and outer waters from the Malvinas current (33.8 to 34.2 psu) generated saline fronts mostly between 53\textdegree{} and 54\textdegree S. A strong thermocline was found between 47\textdegree{} and 51\textdegree S. It registered a maximum gradient of 5\textdegree C/mat 50 m deep waters in the central shelf region. Haloclines were found south of 51\textdegree S at depths between 50-70 m. Sea water density within the northern region was mainly influenced by temperature values whereas salinity was the key factor southwards. Zooplankton densities ranged 18.5 - 2488.8 mg/m3. The largest biomasses were found in coastal waters within the area of Bah\'ia Grande (50\textdegree -52\textdegree S) where T. gaudichaudii was the most abundant species. Differences between day and night zooplankton distribution produced important echo traces only during dark hours.},

Although spatial and temporal patterns in the diet during the breeding season in coastal Chubut have been analyzed, the list of prey species consumed at each location has not yet been reported. The prey trophic spectrum of the Kelp Gull at three protected areas during the 1994 and 1995 breeding seasons is presented. The analysis was based on 1331 and 1515 pellets during 1994 and 1995, respectively. Kelp Gull diet presented at least 38 different prey species. These included at least 8 fish species, 11 crustaceans, 6 pelecipods, 10 gasteropods, and 3 polychaetes, added to a number of unidentified species of octopods, decapods, echinoids, asteroids, birds and insects. Although some prey showed a relatively important frequency of occurrence, most prey showed frequencies lower than 5\%. The observed diversity in the diet of the Kelp Gull at the three analyzed locations confirms it is a generalist and opportunist species. KEY WORDS: Argentina, diet, Kelp Gull, Larus dominicanus.},

  abstract = {We quantified the trophic niche of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) breeding and moulting in Golfo San Jorge, Argentina, through conventional stomach content and stable isotope analysis. A total of 112 adults were flushed during the early and late chick stages of 2011 and 2012 at Isla Vernacci Norte, and at least 15 prey taxa were found, including fishes, cephalopods, crustaceans and polychaetes. Overall, Argentine anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) showed the highest contribution in terms of importance by mass (68.1\textendash 85.3\%, depending on chick stage and year), except for the old chick stage in 2011 when the shortfin squid (Illex argentinus) was the main prey consumed (56.0\%). Based on carbon and nitrogen isotopic values from a total of 256 blood samples, corresponding to young and old chicks and to adults of both sexes sampled throughout the incubation, chick and moult stages at the above mentioned colony and years, Bayesian mixing model outputs showed that Argentine anchovy was always the main prey (48\textendash 86\%). Bayesian mixing model outputs obtained from adults of both sexes and their chicks during the late chick stage of 2013 at Isla Vernacci Norte, Isla Tova and Isla Leones also showed that Argentine anchovy was the main prey consumed. This is the first comprehensive assessment of Magellanic penguin diet composition in northern Patagonia, quantifying the relative contribution of prey in the diet of adults and chicks at different stages of the annual cycle and years, and confirms the relevance of a forage fish such as the Argentine anchovy in its trophic ecology.},
